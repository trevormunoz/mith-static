The recently released beta version of the project’s site includes a digital exploration of Henry Lawes’s 1653 songbook <em>Ayres and Dialogues</em>. The project is a collaboration between the University of Toronto (UoT), the University of Maryland (UMD), and the University of South Carolina (USC). My role (Raff Viglianti) at MITH for this first exploratory phase has focused on designing a data model and an online viewer for the text and musical score of the songs. Prof. Scott Trudell (UMD) and Prof. Sarah Williams (USC) have contributed to shaping the data model and have carried out the encoding work so far.</p>"}},"researchExcerpt":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Early Modern Songscapes is a project exploring the circulation and performance of English Renaissance poetry.</p>"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/da28bf1ec023eff5131be3055ab93468/274bf/header_ems.png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/da28bf1ec023eff5131be3055ab93468/88740/header_ems.png 350w,\n/mith-static/static/da28bf1ec023eff5131be3055ab93468/61fb5/header_ems.png 700w,\n/mith-static/static/da28bf1ec023eff5131be3055ab93468/274bf/header_ems.png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/da28bf1ec023eff5131be3055ab93468/87c9c/header_ems.webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/da28bf1ec023eff5131be3055ab93468/ee7fb/header_ems.webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/da28bf1ec023eff5131be3055ab93468/a2209/header_ems.webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":225}}}},"active":"TRUE","title":"Early Modern Soundscapes","twitter_account":null,"twitter_hashtag":null,"year_start":2019,"month_start":2,"year_end":null,"month_end":null,"participants":[{"name":"Raff Viglianti","affiliations":[{"title":"Research Programmer","department":"Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities","institution":"University of Maryland"},{"title":"Research Programmer","department":"Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":null,"end":null,"person_group":["current"],"slug":"raffaele-viglianti","new_id":6},{"name":"Chad Crichton","affiliations":[{"title":" Liaison Librarian","department":null,"institution":"University of Toronto"}],"start":null,"end":null,"person_group":null,"slug":"chad-crichton","new_id":620}],"directors":[{"name":"Katherine Larson","affiliations":[{"title":"Professor","department":null,"institution":"University of Toronto"}],"start":null,"end":null,"person_group":null,"slug":"katherine-larson","new_id":617},{"name":"Scott Trudell","affiliations":[{"title":"Associate Professor of English","department":null,"institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":null,"end":null,"person_group":null,"slug":"scott-trudell","new_id":618},{"name":"Sarah Williams","affiliations":[{"title":"Associate Professor of Music History","department":null,"institution":"University of South Carolina"}],"start":null,"end":null,"person_group":null,"slug":"sarah-williams","new_id":619}],"links":[{"title":"EMS Beta Site","url":"http://ems.digitalscholarship.utsc.utoronto.ca/","type":"url"}],"sponsors":[],"partners":[{"name":"University of Toronto Scarborough Digital Scholarship Unit","website":"https://digital.utsc.utoronto.ca","type":"External","slug":"utoronto_utsc_dsu"},{"name":"University of Maryland Libraries","website":"lib.umd.edu","type":"Internal","slug":"umdlib"}],"events":[{"id":"early-modern-soundscapes-conference","event_title":"Early Modern Songscapes","talk_title":null,"talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Conference"],"start":"2019-02-08T05:00:00.000Z","end":"2019-02-09T05:00:00.000Z","location":"Victoria College, University of Toronto"}],"posts":[{"post_title":"Launch of Early Modern Songscapes Beta Site: Encoding and Publishing strategies","author":"raffaele-viglianti","author_name":"Raff Viglianti","post_date":"February 13, 2019","slug":"launch-of-early-modern-songscapes-beta-site-encoding-and-publishing-strategies"}],"disciplines":[{"term":"Musicology","type":"Discipline"}],"methods":[]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"]}
