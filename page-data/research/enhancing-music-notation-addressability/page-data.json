However, how can one virtually \"circle\" music notation? and how can a machine interpret this \"circling\" to retrieve music notation?\nTo research these questions, we are teaming up with the <a href=\"http://digitalduchemin.org/\">Du Chemin: Lost Voices</a> project (Haverford College), which is reconstructing songs printed by Nicholas Du Chemin between 1549 and 1568 in Paris. We will work on music analyses already produced by students and scholars as part of the Du Chemin project and re-model them as Linked Open Data nanopublications.\nIn the sciences, nanopublication is providing the research community with ways of managing attribution and documenting quality of even small contributions. The nanopublication model facilitates accurate citation and promotes massively collaborative scholarship. We seek to extend these benefits to humanities scholarship.\nEach EMA nanopublication will address an arbitrary portion of music notation encoded according to the <a href=\"http://music-encoding.org/home\">Music Encoding Initiative</a> (MEI) format. To support these addressing acts, we will develop a prototype application able to return a meaningful selection of encoded music notation.</p>"}},"researchExcerpt":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>EMA is a collaboration with the Du Chemin: Lost Voices project (Haverford College), which is reconstructing songs printed by Nicholas Du Chemin between 1549 and 1568 in Paris.
