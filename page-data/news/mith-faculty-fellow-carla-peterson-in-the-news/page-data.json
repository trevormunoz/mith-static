In <a href=\"http://www.umd.edu/Black_History_Month/peterson.cfm\">\"Online Archive to Share Stories of 19th Century Free Blacks,\"</a> Karen Shih, University Editor, interviews Peterson on her family history, 19th century black New Yorkers, and the origins of her digital archive.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.blackgothamarchive.org/\">Black Gotham Archive</a> is an extension of Dr. Peterson's book, <a href=\"http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300162554\">Black Gotham: A Family History of African Americans in Nineteenth-Century New York City</a> (Yale University Press, 2011). Dr. Peterson has received much well-deserved recognition for her research so far. Just last week, she was featured on The New York Times City Room Blog <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/part-2-mith-faculty-fellow-answers-readers-questions-on-times-taking-questions/\">\"Taking Questions\" series</a>, where she answered readers' questions on 19th century black New York. Tomorrow, February 23rd, Dr. Peterson will be speaking at <a href=\"http://gender.stanford.edu/events/recovering-lives-black-women-19th-century-carla-peterson\">The Clayman Institute for Gender Research at Stanford University</a>, and Saturday the 25th she will be giving a talk in Washington, DC for the Association for the Study of African American Life and History.
