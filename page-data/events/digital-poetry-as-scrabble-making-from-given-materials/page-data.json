Authors create patterns, use collage, make links, sample media during the creative process, and readers are faced with the task of responding to a set of textual circumstances. While illustrating and introducing the basic mechanics of digital poetry, this presentation engages with works as if moves in a game of Scrabble, suggesting how expression can be further propelled using digital and analog media. Beyond the role of influence and inspiration, the output and data presented in digital poems can often be seen and used as a basis for myriad sorts of projective, progenerative language, image, or sound, which can be combined and recombined in so many variations. If literature is to be interactive, we must cultivate ways to respond to what is given, and in the process may find ourselves able to remediate materials in order to build something original.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Chris Funkhouser Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Digital Poetry as Scrabble","talk_subtitle":"Making from Given Materials","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2007-09-18T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2007-09-18T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Chris Funkhouser","affiliations":[{"title":"Associate Professor","department":"Humanities Department","institution":"New Jersey Institute of Technology"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"chris-funkhouser","new_id":403,"headshot":null,"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Poet and scholar, Chris Funkhouser is an Associate Professor in the Humanities Department at New Jersey Institute of Technology.
