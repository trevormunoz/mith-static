Building on the previous sessions, we will demonstrate how temporal, network, sentiment, and geographic analyses on a subset of the Ferguson Twitter can aid understanding and enhance storytelling of a controversial event. These demonstrations will include hands-on exercises on categorizing tweets by location (from inside/outside Ferguson, MO) and sentiment (positive or negative language), visualizing the different groups of people taking part in the discussion, and detecting compelling moments in the data. This workshop will also introduce participants to tools and environments for performing such analysis independently and on other Twitter data sets, so participants should come prepared with a laptop. Workshop participants will gain skills in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Network Analysis</li>\n<li>Sentiment Analysis</li>\n<li>Event Detection</li>\n<li>Data Storytelling</li>\n<li>Includes hands on demonstration of tools</li>\n<li>Data Visualization with NodeXL</li>\n</ul>"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/82e76bfb7559ac47126ee4f2b2753745/716c3/event_dhincubator-teachins.png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/82e76bfb7559ac47126ee4f2b2753745/e1907/event_dhincubator-teachins.png 150w,\n/mith-static/static/82e76bfb7559ac47126ee4f2b2753745/0ca00/event_dhincubator-teachins.png 300w,\n/mith-static/static/82e76bfb7559ac47126ee4f2b2753745/716c3/event_dhincubator-teachins.png 600w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/82e76bfb7559ac47126ee4f2b2753745/b41db/event_dhincubator-teachins.webp 150w,\n/mith-static/static/82e76bfb7559ac47126ee4f2b2753745/9d5e2/event_dhincubator-teachins.webp 300w,\n/mith-static/static/82e76bfb7559ac47126ee4f2b2753745/9a4d4/event_dhincubator-teachins.webp 600w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":700}}}},"event_title":"Session V: Advanced Analytical Techniques","talk_title":null,"talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Workshop"],"start":"2015-04-09T04:00:00.000Z","end":null,"location":null,"speakers":[{"name":"Cody Buntain","affiliations":[{"title":null,"department":"Department of Computer Science","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"cody-buntain","new_id":232},{"name":"Nicolas Diakopoulos","affiliations":[{"title":null,"department":"Journalism Department","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"nicolas-diakopoulos","new_id":325},{"name":"Jen Golbeck","affiliations":[{"title":"Assistant Professor","department":"College of Information Studies","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"jen-golbeck","new_id":271,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#88b8c8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/461de45cc339df2791b79b507c105bb7/498f5/JenGolbeck.jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/461de45cc339df2791b79b507c105bb7/76f2f/JenGolbeck.jpg 624w,\n/mith-static/static/461de45cc339df2791b79b507c105bb7/979a7/JenGolbeck.jpg 1248w,\n/mith-static/static/461de45cc339df2791b79b507c105bb7/498f5/JenGolbeck.jpg 2496w","sizes":"(min-width: 2496px) 2496px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/461de45cc339df2791b79b507c105bb7/c6133/JenGolbeck.webp 624w,\n/mith-static/static/461de45cc339df2791b79b507c105bb7/6256c/JenGolbeck.webp 1248w,\n/mith-static/static/461de45cc339df2791b79b507c105bb7/115b7/JenGolbeck.webp 2496w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 2496px) 2496px, 100vw"}]},"width":2496,"height":2424}}}},{"name":"Ben Shneiderman","affiliations":[{"title":"Professor","department":"Department of Computer Science","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"ben-shneiderman","new_id":211,"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p><a href=\"http://www.cs.umd.edu/~ben\">Ben Schneiderman</a> is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science Founding Director (1983-2000) of the <a href=\"http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/\">Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory</a>, and Member of the Institutes for Advanced Computer Studies &#x26; for Systems Research, all at the University of Maryland at College Park.
