With sadness, we canceled the final two Digital Dialogues of the Spring 2020 season. We will work with Jennifer Garcon on a plan to speak at a later date.</em>\nIn support of the Re/Member Black Philadelphia project, Garcon launched a community data curation pilot in partnership with the Free Library of Philadelphia. The goal of the community-rooted digitization project was to create access pathways to historical records from under-documented communities by producing digital surrogates and offering consultation to expand the life of materials held within the communities of color. As Philadelphia gentrifies at a faster rate than San Francisco, well-resourced institutions need to develop inclusive practices that support on-going community archival efforts. This talk discusses the experience of building an institutional practice that foregrounds partnership and resource sharing in developing digital archives.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Jennifer Garcon Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"(CANCELED) Building a Community Data Curation Practice","talk_subtitle":"Digital Archiving through Partnership and Resource Sharing","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2020-03-24T16:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Jennifer Garcon","affiliations":[{"title":"Bollinger Fellow in Public and Community Data Curation","department":null,"institution":"University of Pennsylvania"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"jennifer-garcon","new_id":453,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#e8e8e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/a5262c77855e49ea007f7a8256902415/baaed/jennifer-garcon.jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/a5262c77855e49ea007f7a8256902415/dd515/jennifer-garcon.jpg 200w,\n/mith-static/static/a5262c77855e49ea007f7a8256902415/47930/jennifer-garcon.jpg 400w,\n/mith-static/static/a5262c77855e49ea007f7a8256902415/baaed/jennifer-garcon.jpg 800w","sizes":"(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/a5262c77855e49ea007f7a8256902415/2e34e/jennifer-garcon.webp 200w,\n/mith-static/static/a5262c77855e49ea007f7a8256902415/416c3/jennifer-garcon.webp 400w,\n/mith-static/static/a5262c77855e49ea007f7a8256902415/c1587/jennifer-garcon.webp 800w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw"}]},"width":800,"height":800}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Jennifer Garcon is the CLIR Bollinger Fellow in Public and Community Data Curation at the University of Pennsylvania, where she facilitates archiving and preservation initiatives geared toward protecting and safeguarding vulnerable data, which includes formats endangered by technological obsolescence and historic data held in communities experiencing gentrification.
