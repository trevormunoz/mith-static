In contrast to Web 2.0, where users as “prosumers” actively participate in the production of that which they consume and often create systems from the bottom-up, the iPad channels passive consumption, corporate control via “closed” systems and a renewed focus on traditional, top-down, pay-per-view media. Indeed, the iPad is engineered to enforce this passivity, for example through lack of a tactile keyboard. The iPad is indicative of Apple’s Disneyfied approach in the way it produces spectacle to enchant or “wow” individuals into passive consumption, attempts to exercise control by creating a “walled garden,” and seeks to monetize more and more of the interactions within the system.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Zeynep Tufekci and Nathan Jurgenson Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"The iPad","talk_subtitle":"The \"Jesus Tablet\" and the Resurrection of Consumer Society","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2010-09-14T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2010-09-14T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Zeynep Tufekci","affiliations":[{"title":"Assistant Professor","department":"Department of Sociology","institution":"University of Maryland Baltimore County"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"zeynep-tufekci","new_id":560,"headshot":null,"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Zeynep Tufekci is an assistant professor of Sociology at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, where her main research interests are the social impacts of technology, theorizing the web, gender, research methods, inequality and new media.
