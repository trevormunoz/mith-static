Such staff members are not well accounted for by the normative division between the “research” usually associated with faculty positions and the “service” usually associated with staff. As a result, career trajectories and methods for their professional development are unclear. This Digital Humanities Level 1 Start Up grant supported a MITH-hosted two-day workshop during January 2011. The online discussion resulted in a white paper and a set of recommendations for establishing career paths within digital humanities centers.</p>"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/4536012a553a74085a8722baf594c5f3/716c3/event_offthetracks.png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/4536012a553a74085a8722baf594c5f3/e1907/event_offthetracks.png 150w,\n/mith-static/static/4536012a553a74085a8722baf594c5f3/0ca00/event_offthetracks.png 300w,\n/mith-static/static/4536012a553a74085a8722baf594c5f3/716c3/event_offthetracks.png 600w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/4536012a553a74085a8722baf594c5f3/b41db/event_offthetracks.webp 150w,\n/mith-static/static/4536012a553a74085a8722baf594c5f3/9d5e2/event_offthetracks.webp 300w,\n/mith-static/static/4536012a553a74085a8722baf594c5f3/9a4d4/event_offthetracks.webp 600w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":700}}}},"event_title":"Off the Tracks Workshop","talk_title":"Off the Tracks","talk_subtitle":"Laying New Lines for Digital Humanities Scholars","type":["Workshop"],"start":"2011-01-20T05:00:00.000Z","end":"2011-01-21T05:00:00.000Z","location":"McKeldin Library, University of Maryland","speakers":[],"participants":[{"name":"Tanya Clement","title":"Program Associate","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland","start":2010,"end":2011,"person_group":null,"slug":"tanya-clement","new_id":96},{"name":"Doug Reside","title":"Associate Director","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland","start":2010,"end":2011,"person_group":null,"slug":"douglas-reside","new_id":29}],"links":[{"title":"Off The Tracks Website","url":"http://mith.umd.edu/offthetracks/","type":"url"},{"title":"White Paper (DRUM)","url":"http://hdl.handle.net/1903/14731","type":"url"}],"sponsors":[{"name":"National Endowment for the Humanities","website":"neh.gov","type":"External","slug":"neh"}],"partners":[{"name":"Design, Cultures and Creativity (DCC)","website":"dcc.umd.edu","type":"Internal","slug":"dcc"}],"research":[{"id":"off-the-tracks","title":"Off the Tracks","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/6882e7c241ec3466218462e3534bdd30/c4ce0/header_offthetracks.jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/6882e7c241ec3466218462e3534bdd30/1367c/header_offthetracks.jpg 350w,\n/mith-static/static/6882e7c241ec3466218462e3534bdd30/df609/header_offthetracks.jpg 700w,\n/mith-static/static/6882e7c241ec3466218462e3534bdd30/c4ce0/header_offthetracks.jpg 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/6882e7c241ec3466218462e3534bdd30/b6bd0/header_offthetracks.webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/6882e7c241ec3466218462e3534bdd30/c73ac/header_offthetracks.webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/6882e7c241ec3466218462e3534bdd30/b9745/header_offthetracks.webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}}],"posts":[{"post_title":"Collaborators’ Bill of Rights from recent \"Off The Tracks\" workshop","author":"mith","author_name":"MITH ","post_date":"January 24, 2011","slug":"collaborators-bill-of-rights-from-recent-off-the-tracks-workshop"},{"post_title":"Advanced TEI Seminar & Workshop on Professionalization in DH Centers","author":"mith","author_name":"MITH ","post_date":"January 19, 2011","slug":"advanced-tei-seminar-off-the-tracks-workshop-on-professionalization-in-dh-centers"},{"post_title":"Welcome Back to MITH!","author":"mith","author_name":"MITH ","post_date":"August 30, 2010","slug":"welcome-back-to-mith"},{"post_title":"MITH Wins Two New NEH Digital Humanities Start Up Grants","author":"mith","author_name":"MITH ","post_date":"August 18, 2010","slug":"mith-wins-two-new-neh-digital-humanities-start-up-grants"}],"disciplines":[],"methods":[]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"]}
