One of our latest projects is <a href=\"http://buildinginspector.nypl.org/\">Building Inspector</a>, a tool to extract data from historic insurance atlases through a combination of computational (vectorization, computer vision, alpha shapes) and human (crowdsourcing, game design concepts) processes. This talk will provide an insight into the Building Inspector and other projects developed by NYPL Labs, with an emphasis on design and HCI-related challenges. For instance: how does one design tools that anyone can use regardless of prior knowledge, to validate computer-generated geographic data or to create stereographic images from 100-year-old photographs?</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Mauricio Giraldo Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Kill Time, Make History","talk_subtitle":"Building Inspector and other HCI Case Studies from NYPL Labs","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2015-03-03T17:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Mauricio Giraldo","affiliations":[{"title":"Interaction Designer/Developer","department":null,"institution":"NYPL Labs"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"mauricio-giraldo","new_id":498,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#e8d8c8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/954798d42a7cafd3b7749ba2a9278440/519b6/mauricio-headshot.jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/954798d42a7cafd3b7749ba2a9278440/2ef07/mauricio-headshot.jpg 125w,\n/mith-static/static/954798d42a7cafd3b7749ba2a9278440/895b8/mauricio-headshot.jpg 250w,\n/mith-static/static/954798d42a7cafd3b7749ba2a9278440/519b6/mauricio-headshot.jpg 500w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/954798d42a7cafd3b7749ba2a9278440/c7be7/mauricio-headshot.webp 125w,\n/mith-static/static/954798d42a7cafd3b7749ba2a9278440/437c4/mauricio-headshot.webp 250w,\n/mith-static/static/954798d42a7cafd3b7749ba2a9278440/e1161/mauricio-headshot.webp 500w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"}]},"width":500,"height":494}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Mauricio enjoys playing with code, objects and all things interactive.
