Composed at Bell Labs, in collaboration with engineers, and written in an early version of FORTRAN, <em>Etude</em> stands as one of the earliest works of digital art<em>—_although it is not entirely clear whether _Etude</em> was, in fact, the “computer opera” that Paik mentions elsewhere in his writings, or another artwork altogether. By exploring <em>Etude</em>’s uncertain status, as well as the piece’s more conceptual indeterminacies—between image and code, analog and digital, and film and music—this paper demonstrates how such indefinite artifacts allow for a rethinking of the nature of the archive, cinema’s digital past, and film’s place in computational media.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Gregory Zinman Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Nam June Paik’s Etude and the Indeterminate Origins of Digital Media Art","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2016-10-18T16:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Gregory Zinman","affiliations":[{"title":"Assistant Professor of of Literature, Media, and Communication","department":null,"institution":"Georgia Institute of Technology"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"gregory-zinman","new_id":435,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#282828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/885847e6bb8becabd4d8dd77bb0d3bd7/b0f91/Gregory-Zinman-e1470260926906.jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/885847e6bb8becabd4d8dd77bb0d3bd7/d71cc/Gregory-Zinman-e1470260926906.jpg 67w,\n/mith-static/static/885847e6bb8becabd4d8dd77bb0d3bd7/c3b86/Gregory-Zinman-e1470260926906.jpg 135w,\n/mith-static/static/885847e6bb8becabd4d8dd77bb0d3bd7/b0f91/Gregory-Zinman-e1470260926906.jpg 269w","sizes":"(min-width: 269px) 269px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/885847e6bb8becabd4d8dd77bb0d3bd7/536da/Gregory-Zinman-e1470260926906.webp 67w,\n/mith-static/static/885847e6bb8becabd4d8dd77bb0d3bd7/88ccf/Gregory-Zinman-e1470260926906.webp 135w,\n/mith-static/static/885847e6bb8becabd4d8dd77bb0d3bd7/fa202/Gregory-Zinman-e1470260926906.webp 269w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 269px) 269px, 100vw"}]},"width":269,"height":321}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Gregory Zinman is an Assistant Professor in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication at Georgia Tech.
