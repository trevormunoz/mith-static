Most such work focuses on explicitly expressed opinions, e.g. automatically labeling movie reviews as favorable or unfavorable. In this talk, we will focus on a less studied problem: the computational analysis of implicit sentiment, or spin, in text. We identify underlying semantic properties of statements that predict perceptions of sentiment, and we show how observable syntactic reflexes of those properties can be used, fully automatically, to accurately label a text as expressing a positive or negative attitude toward its topic, even in the absence of overtly opinionated language.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Stephan Greene and Philip Resnik Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"The Linguistics of Spin","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2007-11-13T17:30:00.000Z","end":"2007-11-13T18:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Stephan Greene","affiliations":[{"title":"PhD Candidate","department":"Department of Linguistics","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"stephan-greene","new_id":555,"headshot":null,"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Stephan Greene is a recent Ph.D. graduate of the UMD Department of Linguistics, and works at ATG, a leading provider of Web marketing and e-commerce software.</p>"}}},{"name":"Philip Resnik","affiliations":[{"title":"Associate Professor","department":"Department of Linguistics and the Institute for Advanced Computer Studies","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"philip-resnik","new_id":556,"headshot":null,"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Philip Resnik is an associate professor at UMD with joint appointments in the Department of Linguistics and the Institute for Advanced Computer Studies.</p>"}}}],"participants":[],"links":[],"sponsors":[],"partners":[],"research":[{"id":"mith-digital-dialogues","title":"Digital Dialogues","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#281818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues.png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/d61d9/header_digital-dialogues.png 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/40d29/header_digital-dialogues.png 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues.png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b6bd0/header_digital-dialogues.webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/c73ac/header_digital-dialogues.webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b9745/header_digital-dialogues.webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}}],"posts":[{"post_title":"11/13 MITH Digital Dialogue: Stephan Greene and Philip Resnik","author":"digital-dialogues","author_name":"Digital Dialogues","post_date":"November 8, 2007","slug":"november-13th-digital-dialogue-stephan-greene-and-philip-resnik-the-linguistics-of-spin"}],"disciplines":[],"methods":[]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"]}
