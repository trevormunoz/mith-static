Their field is one of exceptionally large and uncertain scale, subject to ongoing transformation and dispute, and shrouded in copyright. I will present one possible way forward, based on my work for a special issue of <em>Modern Language Quarterly</em> on \"Scale &#x26; Value\" that I'm co-editing with Ted Underwood. My project uses quantitative relationships among mid-sized, hand-made datasets to map the field of Anglophone fiction from 1960 to the present. Some significant findings of this research concern a shift in the typical time-setting of the novel and a concomitant change in the relationship between literary commerce and literary prestige. </p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"James English Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"What Counts as Contemporary Fiction?
