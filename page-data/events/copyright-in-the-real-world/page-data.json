As yet, we know little about the operation of copyright in the digital environment, and archives and other cultural heritage institutions are seeking to develop best practices that will make their holdings more widely available while protecting the legitimate interests of rights holders. Jean Dryden will discuss the findings of her doctoral dissertation, which found that Canadian repositories' copyright practices in making their holding available online are more restrictive than copyright law envisages, both in terms of what they select for Internet access, and their attempts to control further uses of their online holdings.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Jean Dryden Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Copyright in the Real World","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2009-02-17T17:30:00.000Z","end":"2009-02-17T18:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Jean Dryden","affiliations":[{"title":null,"department":"College of Information Studies","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"jean-dryden","new_id":450,"headshot":null,"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>In 2008, Jean Dryden joined the faculty of University of Maryland's iSchool, where she teaches in the archives, records, and information management program.
