Inspired, I am developing ways of documenting and visualizing not only what I read, but also what caused me to read using linked open data. Through a custom Jekyll plugin, RDFa triples are extracted from my reading notes text files. The plugin writes JSON-LD triplets, which are then used as input for a variety of visualizations.\nTracing reading reveals the breadths and depths of interconnected themes among works that, initially, are connected simply because I noticed one influenced me to read the other. The visualizations enable movement between big-picture views of the corpus and close-readings of individual books and can reveal adjacent possibilities in themes, readings, as well as shape questions that may be currently unarticulated.\nInfluenced by feminist interface design, this talk will focus on the design and creation of visualizations – as finding aids, as maps into the landscape of a personal corpus. </p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Purdom Lindblad Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Finding Aids for the Unread","talk_subtitle":"Design for the Visualization of Reading","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2016-10-04T16:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Purdom Lindblad","affiliations":[{"title":"Assistant Director of Innovation and Learning","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"person_group":["current"],"slug":"purdom-lindblad","new_id":3,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#484848","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/4d23b2a882b42296bf0a53d45f230984/1f55a/purdom-lindblad-3.jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/4d23b2a882b42296bf0a53d45f230984/a7b73/purdom-lindblad-3.jpg 375w,\n/mith-static/static/4d23b2a882b42296bf0a53d45f230984/0f5ce/purdom-lindblad-3.jpg 750w,\n/mith-static/static/4d23b2a882b42296bf0a53d45f230984/1f55a/purdom-lindblad-3.jpg 1500w","sizes":"(min-width: 1500px) 1500px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/4d23b2a882b42296bf0a53d45f230984/e3305/purdom-lindblad-3.webp 375w,\n/mith-static/static/4d23b2a882b42296bf0a53d45f230984/4f03f/purdom-lindblad-3.webp 750w,\n/mith-static/static/4d23b2a882b42296bf0a53d45f230984/07142/purdom-lindblad-3.webp 1500w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1500px) 1500px, 100vw"}]},"width":1500,"height":1500}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Purdom Lindblad is the Assistant Director of Innovation and Learning at MITH.
