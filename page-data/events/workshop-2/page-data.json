Her research and teaching interests focus on new media and the digital humanities, textual scholarship and print culture, digital preservation, transmedia storytelling, and game studies. Kraus is a local Co-PI on an Institute of Museum and Library Services grant for preserving virtual worlds; the PI on an IMLS Digital Humanities Internship grant; and, with Derek Hansen (iSchool), the Co-Principal Investigator of the NSF grant underwriting the design of AGOG. Her work has been published or is forthcoming in <em>The Cambridge Companion to Textual Scholarship</em>; <em>Digital Humanities Quarterly</em>; <em>Digital Media: Interdisciplinary Perspectives on History, Preservation, and Ontology; The Journal of Visual Culture</em>; and<em> Studies in Romanticism</em>. She first became interested in ARGs when Marc Ruppel, a PhD student in the Department of English, introduced her to <em>Cathy’s Book</em>, billed as the first alternate reality game developed specifically for the publishing industry. In 2008, in conjunction with the University of Maryland’s Mobility Initiative, she and her graduate students designed a mobile scavenger hunt that they playtested with a group of undergraduate students who had received free iPhones and iPod Touches as part of the Provost’s pilot project. Inspired by ARGs, the on-campus hunt made use of the technological affordances of the iPhone and iTouch – e.g., camera, phone, texting, and GPS functionality – to enhance interactivity and integrate the offline and online worlds in creative ways. The narrative framework was designed to teach students about University of Maryland history, particularly the Great Fire of 1912.</p>"}}}],"participants":[],"links":[{"title":"Institute Website","url":"http://dhcuration.org/institute/","type":"url"}],"sponsors":[{"name":"National Endowment for the Humanities","website":"neh.gov","type":"External","slug":"neh"}],"partners":[],"research":[{"id":"data-curation","title":"Digital Humanities Data Curation","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/da2876c7c424b8e1cd4348c2fcfe6a98/e34e2/header_dhdc.png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/da2876c7c424b8e1cd4348c2fcfe6a98/d61d9/header_dhdc.png 350w,\n/mith-static/static/da2876c7c424b8e1cd4348c2fcfe6a98/40d29/header_dhdc.png 700w,\n/mith-static/static/da2876c7c424b8e1cd4348c2fcfe6a98/e34e2/header_dhdc.png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/da2876c7c424b8e1cd4348c2fcfe6a98/b6bd0/header_dhdc.webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/da2876c7c424b8e1cd4348c2fcfe6a98/c73ac/header_dhdc.webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/da2876c7c424b8e1cd4348c2fcfe6a98/b9745/header_dhdc.webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}}],"posts":[],"disciplines":[],"methods":[]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"]}
