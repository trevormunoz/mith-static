Topic models, which automatically discover the themes which permeate a corpus, are a popular tool for discovering what’s being discussed. However, topic models aren’t perfect; errors hamper adoption of the model, performance in downstream computational tasks, and human understanding of the data. However, humans can easily diagnose and fix these errors. We present a statistically sound model to incorporate hints and suggestions from humans to iteratively refine topic models to better model large datasets.\nWe also examine how topic models can be used to understand topic control in debates and discussions. We demonstrate a technique that can identify when speakers are “controlling” the topic of a conversation, which can identify events such as when participants in a debate don’t answer a question, when pundits steer a conversation toward talking points, or when a moderator exerts her influence on a discourse.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Jordan Boyd-Graber Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Making Topics More Human(e)","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2012-04-10T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2012-04-10T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Seminar Room","speakers":[{"name":"Jordan Boyd-Graber","affiliations":[{"title":"Assistant Professor","department":"School of Information Studies and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS)","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"jordan-boyd-graber","new_id":463,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/ac2790e235632f9513725ecb26b21c83/3a19d/Jordan-Boyd-Graber1.png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/ac2790e235632f9513725ecb26b21c83/cecf4/Jordan-Boyd-Graber1.png 188w,\n/mith-static/static/ac2790e235632f9513725ecb26b21c83/66aec/Jordan-Boyd-Graber1.png 375w,\n/mith-static/static/ac2790e235632f9513725ecb26b21c83/3a19d/Jordan-Boyd-Graber1.png 750w","sizes":"(min-width: 750px) 750px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/ac2790e235632f9513725ecb26b21c83/8fe1c/Jordan-Boyd-Graber1.webp 188w,\n/mith-static/static/ac2790e235632f9513725ecb26b21c83/fc9e8/Jordan-Boyd-Graber1.webp 375w,\n/mith-static/static/ac2790e235632f9513725ecb26b21c83/520c4/Jordan-Boyd-Graber1.webp 750w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 750px) 750px, 100vw"}]},"width":750,"height":633}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p><strong>Jordan Boyd-Graber</strong> is an assistant professor in Maryland’s iSchool and UMIACS, and a member of the Cloud Computing Center and the Computational Linguistics and Information Processing (CLIP) Lab. His research applies statistical models to natural language problems in ways that interact with humans, learn from humans, or help researchers understand humans. Jordan is an expert in the application of topic models, completely automatic tools that can discover structure and meaning in large, multilingual datasets. He is a contributor to the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), a popular tool used in natural language education research. Jordan received his PhD from Princeton University in 2010, advised by Dave Blei, and has bachelors degrees in history and computer science from the California Institute of Technology. He received a best student paper honorable mention at NIPS 2009 and a Computing Innovation Fellowship (declined).
