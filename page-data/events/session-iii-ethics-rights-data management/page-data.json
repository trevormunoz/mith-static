These questions are especially vital when social media data is being used to study social justice issues.\nIn this workshop we’ll review basic research ethics for public datasets, and then discuss unsolved ethical challenges for the use of Twitter data. We will also discuss strategies for ensuring best-effort ethical approaches in this emerging research space. We’ll also consider Twitter datasets as materials for current and future archives—how is this medium redefining archival sources and notions of historical evidence? If we think of this data as part of a historical record does that change our evaluation of how the collection of data we have reflects actual public sentiments (its representativeness), and what biases might it reflect or contain in its construction. Who/what is being remembered, and who/what is being forgotten, when we study and preserve such data? And, finally, in order to facilitate active research now and maintain this data into the future we’ll cover basic strategies for managing and maintaining social media data collected as part of research.</p>"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/82e76bfb7559ac47126ee4f2b2753745/716c3/event_dhincubator-teachins.png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/82e76bfb7559ac47126ee4f2b2753745/e1907/event_dhincubator-teachins.png 150w,\n/mith-static/static/82e76bfb7559ac47126ee4f2b2753745/0ca00/event_dhincubator-teachins.png 300w,\n/mith-static/static/82e76bfb7559ac47126ee4f2b2753745/716c3/event_dhincubator-teachins.png 600w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/82e76bfb7559ac47126ee4f2b2753745/b41db/event_dhincubator-teachins.webp 150w,\n/mith-static/static/82e76bfb7559ac47126ee4f2b2753745/9d5e2/event_dhincubator-teachins.webp 300w,\n/mith-static/static/82e76bfb7559ac47126ee4f2b2753745/9a4d4/event_dhincubator-teachins.webp 600w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":700}}}},"event_title":"Session III: Ethics, Rights, Data Management","talk_title":"Ethics, Rights, Data Management","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Workshop"],"start":"2015-04-29T16:00:00.000Z","end":"2015-04-29T17:30:00.000Z","location":"Library Media Services, Hornbake Library","speakers":[{"name":"Katie Shilton","affiliations":[{"title":"Assistant Professor","department":"College of Information Studies","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"katie-shilton","new_id":294,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#c8c8c8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/9364f307956cf74e729780a854e9c28c/19099/Shilton2013.jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/9364f307956cf74e729780a854e9c28c/fd44c/Shilton2013.jpg 75w,\n/mith-static/static/9364f307956cf74e729780a854e9c28c/02bb7/Shilton2013.jpg 150w,\n/mith-static/static/9364f307956cf74e729780a854e9c28c/19099/Shilton2013.jpg 300w","sizes":"(min-width: 300px) 300px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/9364f307956cf74e729780a854e9c28c/57bf1/Shilton2013.webp 75w,\n/mith-static/static/9364f307956cf74e729780a854e9c28c/7be42/Shilton2013.webp 150w,\n/mith-static/static/9364f307956cf74e729780a854e9c28c/f6d56/Shilton2013.webp 300w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 300px) 300px, 100vw"}]},"width":300,"height":218}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p><strong>Katie Shilton</strong>'s research focuses on ethics and policy for the design of information technologies, systems, and collections in the College of Information Studies at the University of Maryland.
