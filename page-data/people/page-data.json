This includes working directly with UMD Libraries on special projects, as well as with other UMD departments and outside institutions on developing new projects and partnerships.\nStephanie’s research revolves around the intersections between digital humanities, libraries, and audiovisual archives: how archival audiovisual media objects function as primary historical documents, and what kind of digital resources and user interfaces facilitate the means for exploring that media in the context of its original production and reception. As MITH’s former Project Manager, she is also interested in the stewardship of digital humanities projects and research data, including streamlining project management, documentation, and sustainability processes.\nShe has a bachelor’s degree in Film Studies and English from the University of Kansas, and a master’s degree in Moving Image Archive Studies from UCLA.\nIn the past, Stephanie was the Project Manager for the [American Archive of Public Broadcasting](http://americanarchive.org/about-the-american-archive) at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, where she managed strategic operational planning for metadata and digitization initiatives. Before moving to DC in 2010, she was the Project Director on a Getty-funded grant for Los Angeles Filmforum entitled _[Alternative Projections: Experimental Film in LA 1945 -1980](http://www.alternativeprojections.com/)_, a historical survey and preservation project resulting in over 35 new oral histories, an academic symposium, a media-rich website and database and a 16+screening exhibition series. The project was part of the Getty’s _Pacific Standard Time_ initiative showcasing postwar art in Los Angeles. She also served as Managing Director of [iotaCenter](http://www.iotacenter.org/), a small nonprofit film archive of experimental film and abstract animation. Before graduate school, Stephanie worked for six years as a researcher and producer on documentaries and television shows, and specialized in finding and licensing archival footage and photos for use in productions.\n"}],"fields":{"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#483838","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/dd79149b3f950d6f95d8ad2761bf02ac/c9753/stephanie-sapienza.jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/dd79149b3f950d6f95d8ad2761bf02ac/77d98/stephanie-sapienza.jpg 125w,\n/mith-static/static/dd79149b3f950d6f95d8ad2761bf02ac/c66cd/stephanie-sapienza.jpg 250w,\n/mith-static/static/dd79149b3f950d6f95d8ad2761bf02ac/c9753/stephanie-sapienza.jpg 500w,\n/mith-static/static/dd79149b3f950d6f95d8ad2761bf02ac/b50ab/stephanie-sapienza.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/dd79149b3f950d6f95d8ad2761bf02ac/484b6/stephanie-sapienza.webp 125w,\n/mith-static/static/dd79149b3f950d6f95d8ad2761bf02ac/e1e56/stephanie-sapienza.webp 250w,\n/mith-static/static/dd79149b3f950d6f95d8ad2761bf02ac/137f3/stephanie-sapienza.webp 500w,\n/mith-static/static/dd79149b3f950d6f95d8ad2761bf02ac/b53c7/stephanie-sapienza.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"}]},"width":500,"height":500}}}}},{"id":"ed-summers","new_id":8,"name":"Ed Summers","first":"Ed","last":"Summers","website":"https://inkdroid.org","twitter":"edsu","current_identities":[{"id":433,"title":"Research Faculty","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland","person_bio":"Ed is a researcher and software developer working at the intersection of information technology and memory studies.

He's originally from Durham, NC and he spent four years of his adolescence in Ile-Ife, Nigeria—his father’s birthplace and one of the cultural touchstones that he incorporates into his scholarship and genre-blending creative writing.\nIn the digital humanities, Kola is focused on exploring the dynamics of emerging technologies in relation to marginalized communities within the US and abroad. His undergraduate thesis specifically looked at how these communities used virtual spaces and technology in ways that subverted their mainstream, intended use. These moments of disruption are his primary interest and Kola continues to expand on this work through his position at AADHum.\nHis fiction is also inspired by these cultural and technological intersections—the new ways that the material world changes how people engage with each other. Though these narratives tend to manifest through prose, Kola has also developed mixed media projects implementing video, glitch art, and prose fiction. Kola’s speculative short stories can be found in Clarkesworld and FIYAH, and he was a writer-in-residence at Beijing's Red Gate Gallery in 2019.\nKola has degrees in Computer Science and English from Amherst College, and he is currently represented by Matt Belford at the Tobias Literary Agency.

That is, her research has a decidedly social justice centered purpose and end goal. Her research interests include histories of Black education, Black women’s higher education, activist scholars, Black Feminisms. She is most interested in historical and contemporary issues of equity, agency, and thriving in education. In her dissertation research for example, she used oral history methodology to explore the organizing and activism experiences of Black women who attended a Southeastern historically Black university during the Civil Rights/Black Power Era. Such scholarship provides valuable information and possibilities for current organizers and activists.\nTurner holds a Ph.D. in Education Policy, Organization & Leadership with a concentration in History of Education from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and degrees from Fayetteville State University (B.A. History) and Fayetteville Technical Community College (A.A.S.
