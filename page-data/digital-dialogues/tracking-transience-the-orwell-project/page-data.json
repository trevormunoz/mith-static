After an erroneous tip called into law enforcement authorities in 2002, Elahi was subjected to an intensive post 9-11 investigation by the FBI. After undergoing six months of interrogations and nine consecutive lie-detector tests, he was cleared of suspicions. After this harrowing experience, Elahi conceived \"<a href=\"http://trackingtransience.net\">Tracking Transience</a>\", a self-tracking system that constantly and publicly presents his exact location, activities, and other personal data. This self-surveillance project is a critique of contemporary investigative techniques and provides an ongoing \"alibi\" for Elahi in the event of future accusations.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Hasan Elahi Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Tracking Transience","talk_subtitle":"The Orwell Project","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2010-10-26T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2010-10-26T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Hasan Elahi","affiliations":[{"title":"Associate Professor of Art","department":null,"institution":"University of Maryland"}],"website":"http://elahi.umd.edu/track","twitter":"hasanmelahi","slug":"hasan-elahi","new_id":437,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#282828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/83134928674013248866d1d44be44120/0b8ee/hasan-elahi.jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/83134928674013248866d1d44be44120/8a803/hasan-elahi.jpg 148w,\n/mith-static/static/83134928674013248866d1d44be44120/7550e/hasan-elahi.jpg 295w,\n/mith-static/static/83134928674013248866d1d44be44120/0b8ee/hasan-elahi.jpg 590w","sizes":"(min-width: 590px) 590px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/83134928674013248866d1d44be44120/077e2/hasan-elahi.webp 148w,\n/mith-static/static/83134928674013248866d1d44be44120/86ef2/hasan-elahi.webp 295w,\n/mith-static/static/83134928674013248866d1d44be44120/48e29/hasan-elahi.webp 590w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 590px) 590px, 100vw"}]},"width":590,"height":300}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Hasan Elahi is an interdisciplinary artist whose work examines issues of surveillance, simulated time, transport systems, borders and frontiers.
