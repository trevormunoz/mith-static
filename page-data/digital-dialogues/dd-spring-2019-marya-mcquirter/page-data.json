Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr to a fuller and more complex understanding of the entire year. Through deep dives in numerous archives and the curation of 365 #OTD stories and photographs in 2018, the dc 1968 project illumines how <em>loud</em> 1968 archives actually are, how white-owned media outlets like the <em>Washington Post</em> and the <em>Washingtonian</em> magazine <em>silence</em> their own archives, and how archives are also <em>quiet</em>, providing evidence of joy and mobility in the city.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Marya McQuirter Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"1968 Archives are Loud AF","talk_subtitle":"Using DH to Transform Narratives About 1968 & \"The Archive\"","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2019-03-05T17:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Marya McQuirter","affiliations":[{"title":"Curator","department":null,"institution":"dc1968 project"}],"website":"https://dc1968project.com","twitter":"maryamcquirter","slug":"marya-mcquirter","new_id":495,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/49ee185e1ff74935d14890d750ec48ae/49e5d/marya-mcquirter.jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/49ee185e1ff74935d14890d750ec48ae/a8ed1/marya-mcquirter.jpg 55w,\n/mith-static/static/49ee185e1ff74935d14890d750ec48ae/429cc/marya-mcquirter.jpg 110w,\n/mith-static/static/49ee185e1ff74935d14890d750ec48ae/49e5d/marya-mcquirter.jpg 220w","sizes":"(min-width: 220px) 220px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/49ee185e1ff74935d14890d750ec48ae/366ce/marya-mcquirter.webp 55w,\n/mith-static/static/49ee185e1ff74935d14890d750ec48ae/32250/marya-mcquirter.webp 110w,\n/mith-static/static/49ee185e1ff74935d14890d750ec48ae/d914a/marya-mcquirter.webp 220w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 220px) 220px, 100vw"}]},"width":220,"height":165}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Marya Annette McQuirter, curator of the dc1968 project, is an independent curator, researcher and writer in Washington, DC.
