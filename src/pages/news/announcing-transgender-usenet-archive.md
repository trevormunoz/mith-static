title: Announcing the Transgender Usenet Archive!
---

I’m happy to announce that after almost a year of hard work, the Transgender Usenet Archive is now [officially available](http://mith.umd.edu/research/transgender-usenet-archive/) for public use! You can search the archive for any single word or two word phrase, and searches can be filtered by newsgroup or post publication year. By default, all searches are case sensitive, but this setting can be changed under the "Case" header on the far right corner next to the "Search" button. Each search result under "click for texts" includes a link to a plain text file of that message, including date and message subject. Feel free to query the archive and see what you find!

This project has been an incredible learning experience for me, and I couldn’t have completed it without the generous support of the MITH staff, whose support, guidance, and expertise were invaluable throughout the process.
