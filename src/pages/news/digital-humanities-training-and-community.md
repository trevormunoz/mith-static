For the last few months, my colleagues and I at MITH have been working behind the scenes to establish the [Digital Humanities Winter Institute (DHWI)](http://mith.umd.edu/research/dhwi-2013/ "DHWI 2013"). An extension of the highly-successful [Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI)](http://www.dhsi.org) at the University of Victoria, DHWI will offer seven courses and a number of extracurricular events to serve the growing need for basic, intermediate, and advanced training in digital humanities. I'm delighted to announce that DHSI, the [Digital.Humanities@Oxford Summer School](http://digital.humanities.ox.ac.uk/dhoxss/), the [European Summer School in Digital Humanities](http://www.culingtec.uni-leipzig.de/ESU_C_T/) at the University of Leipzeig, and [DHWI](http://mith.umd.edu/dhwi/) are working together to establish a network of DH training institutes, with more locations to be announced soon.

Thanks to Ray Siemens at the University of Victoria, Canada, Elizabeth Burr at the University of Leipzeig, Germany, and Sebastian Rahtz and James Cumming at the University of Oxford, United Kingdom, for including us in this new initiative. We invite interested humanists, computer scientists, librarians, and cultural heritage specialists to join this effort by attending one of these institutes.
