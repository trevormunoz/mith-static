title: Collaborators’ Bill of Rights from recent "Off The Tracks" workshop
---

The recent workshop [“Off the Tracks—Laying New Lines for Digital Humanities Scholars”](http://mith.umd.edu/offthetracks/) held on January 20th and 21st, 2011 at MITH was an extreme success and we are grateful to our now former Associate Director, Doug Reside and current Research Associate, Tanya Clement for their leadership. One of the most salient outcomes of the workshop is a [Collaborators' Bill of Rights](http://mith.umd.edu/offthetracks/recommendations/).

In the afternoon of the last day of the workshop, the participants divided into four subgroups tasked with discussing models for institutional support, models for career paths, models for collaboration, and models for transformation. This initial draft was written by the “collaboration team” which includes Matthew Kirschenbaum, Bethany Nowviskie, Tom Scheinfeldt, and Doug Reside. They posted [a very rough draft](http://mith.umd.edu/offthetracks/recommendations/) just hours later in the hopes that it would provoke further discussion by the larger community. The larger community has responded with [poignant comments](http://mith.umd.edu/offthetracks/recommendations/) and on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/#trx4hx). The hashtag for the event was #trx4hx.

The entire draft of recommendations are forthcoming.
