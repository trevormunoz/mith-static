title:
  Digital Lecture Series on the Impact of Feminist Activisms in the 21st Century
  Starts Today
---

During her tenure as Clara and Robert Vambery Distinguished Professor of Comparative Studies, MITH fellow [Hester Baer](http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/hester-baer/) will be collaborating with an international group of scholars to convene a conversation around feminist activisms through digital lectures and discussions on social media. This exciting series of lectures starts today.

From the abstract for the series:

"Feminisms in the Digital Age: Transnational Activism in Germany and Beyond" is a digital lecture series that explores the political impact of feminist activisms in the 21st century. In five lectures and a concluding roundtable, we interrogate the digital interface of transnational protest movements and local activism in feminist politics. The lectures take contemporary German protest culture as a case study for the manner in which transnational feminist activism intersects with the national configuration of feminist political work. We explore how movements and actions from outside Germanyâ€™s borders circulate digitally and resonate differently in new local contexts, and further, how these border-crossings transform grass-roots activism as it goes digital.
