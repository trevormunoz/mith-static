MITH is pleased to announce that we have begun regular Podcasting of our popular Digital Dialogues seminar series:

mith.umd.edu/digitaldialogues

We have three Podcasts from recent Digital Dialogues already available, including talks by Rice University's **Chuck Henry** on scholarly electronic publishing, Brown's** Vika Zafrin** on collaboration in the digital humanities, and game studies from internationally renowned media theorist and author **Stuart Moulthrop**.

A "Podcast" is an MP3 audio recording. You can access and listen to them in a variety of ways. First, by going to the URL above and clicking on the session you want to hear, the MP3 audio file will open and play using your browser's standard audio plugin. You can also subscribe to an RSS feed of the Digital Dialgoues Podcast right from MITH's front page ([http://www.mith.umd.edu/](http://mith.umd.edu/ "Home")). Simply click on the buttons for the RSS options as they appear at the bottom of the right-hand column. (Firefox users can also click the orange radio wave icon that appears in their address bar.) Subscribing to the RSS feed means you will automatically receive new Podcasts as they become available through your RSS reader, and you can also synch them to your portable music player to hear Digital Dialogues on the go.

We plan to make this a regular feature of Digital Dialogues, pending the approval of individual speakers. Of course you'll still have to come to MITH Tuesday's at 12:30 to see any visuals associated with a talk, participate in the conversation, and share some of our coffee and cookies. Enjoy!
