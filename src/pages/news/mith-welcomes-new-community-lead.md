We are delighted to introduce Emma Millon, MITH's new Community Lead.

Emma arrives at MITH from the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts, National Gallery of Art, where she worked for three years as text-encoder and project manager for the Accademia di San Luca research database ([http://www.nga.gov/casva/accademia](https://web.archive.org/web/20160619093641/http://www.nga.gov:80/casva/accademia/)). When she wasn't tagging, Emma organized digital humanities discussions with various institutions, including University of California, Los Angeles, University of Virginia, Library of Congress, and the British Museum. Emma is greatly interested in the capacity of new media and technologies to enhance humanities scholarship and issues involving the relationship between text and images, and visual perception. She holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in English Literature and Italian from Harvard College.

We're very much looking forward to working with her!
