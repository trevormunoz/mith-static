title: Shelley-Godwin Archive Seeking Applications for Text-Encoders
---

MITH is currently seeking applications for two part-time (10 hours per week) positions as Text-Encoders to join the [Shelley-Godwin Archive](http://www.shelleygodwinarchive.org/) project.

Due to a generous grant from the [National Endowment for the Humanities](http://www.neh.gov/), the Shelley-Godwin Archive is currently digitizing various works of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, William Godwin, Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Wollstonecraft. Humanities scholars, curators, and information scientists are partnering from MITH, [The New York Public Library (NYPL)](http://www.nypl.org/), the [Bodleian Libraries](http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/) of the University of Oxford, the [Houghton Library](http://hcl.harvard.edu/libraries/houghton/) of Harvard University, the [Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens](http://www.huntington.org/), and the [British Library](http://www.bl.uk/), to put manuscripts and early editions of these Romantic writers online and freely accessible to the public.

The text encoders will be responsible for producing XML-encoded transcription of materials from the five partner institutions according to the widely-adopted Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standard.

Applicants must have strong computer skills; be well-organized; have strong attention to detail; and have an interest in electronic publishing and digital technology. Experience with XML technologies; a background in English, Literature, Library and Information Science, or a related field; and experience with version control systems and software (especially Git) is preferred. Wages are commensurate with experience, with a range from \$12-15 per hour. Positions begin January 15, 2012 and end December 15, 2012, with the potential for a second year renewable based on availability of funds.

Interested applicants should submit a cover letter and CV to [mith@umd.edu](mailto:mith@umd.edu) with SGA Encoder in the subject line. Applications will be accepted until the positions are filled. Please visit the [~~job announcement~~](http://mith.umd.edu/about/jobs) to read further details.

\*Update- Janauary 6, 2012: Thank you for your interest in the Shelley Godwin Archive. The application submission process is now closed.\*
