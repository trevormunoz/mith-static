Two MITH Directors played key roles at the 2014 Digital Preservation conference, the annual meeting of the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program and the National Digital Stewardship Alliance. The goal of the conference is to bring together the brightest minds exploring solutions to the challenges of stewarding digital content over the long-term. Associate Director [Matthew Kirschenbaum](http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/matthew-kirschenbaum/) delivered the opening plenary at 9:30am Tuesday the 24th, entitled “Software, It’s a Thing,” which built upon his earlier work on the [Preservation of Virtual Worlds](http://web.archive.org/web/20150709192456/http://pvw.illinois.edu:80/pvw/) project and on the [Preserving.exe](http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/meetings/preservingsoftware2013.html) project, which focused on the preservation of software.

Muñoz was recognized for his work developing and teaching best practices in data curation in the digital humanities and for his work advocating for digital preservation as a core function of librarianship, archival work, and scholarship.
