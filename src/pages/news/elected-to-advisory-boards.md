MITH Acting Director Neil Fraistat has been re-elected to the Executive Council of the [Association for Computers and the Humanities](http://www.ach.org/), the premier North American organization for its field. He is joined there by Susan Schreibman, the University Library's Head of Digital Collections and Research, thus ensuring Maryland's ongoing representation in this important organization (Matthew Kirschenbaum and Martha Nell Smith have both previously served on the Executive Council).

Also, MITH Acting Associate Director Matthew Kirschenbaum has accepted an invitation to join the advisory board of Chadwyck-Healey's [Literature Online](http://lion.chadwyck.com/marketing/index.jsp), the world's largest cross-searchable database of literature and criticism.
