MITH's ongoing research in digital curation and preservation is featured prominently in the front-page story "[Archiving Writers' Work in an Age of E-Mail](http://chronicle.com/weekly/v55/i31/31a00102.htm)" in this week's edition of the Chronicle of Higher Education.

The story profiles the challenges and opportunities associated with libraries and archives receiving disks, drives, and sometimes entire computers as part of an author's literary "papers." This work is being actively pursued at MITH in conjunction with our research partners at Emory University and the Harry Ransom Center. Both Matthew Kirschenbaum and Doug Reside comment in the article.
