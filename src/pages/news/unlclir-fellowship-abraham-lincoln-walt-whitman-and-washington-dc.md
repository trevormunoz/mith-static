The University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries offer a one-year Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Humanities. The Fellow will be based in the University Libraries' Digital Initiatives & Special Collections Department (DISC) and will be involved in a major Center for Digital Research in the Humanities project dealing with Abraham Lincoln, Walt Whitman, and Washington, D.C. during the Civil War. Through this and other projects of the CDRH, the individual will assist in broadening access to unique cultural resources and learn about the development of a scholarly digital project from its inception including standards, methodologies, changing research and information needs based on digital media, digital preservation and sustainability, copyright, and funding.
