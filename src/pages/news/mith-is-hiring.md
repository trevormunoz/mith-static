Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH)

This twelve-month GA position will report directly to MITH's Acting Director.

MITH Program Associates work in a dynamic environment, usually on several different projects.

Candidates should have a solid background in web technologies, including XML, HTML, and CSS.
