title: MITH Fellow Angel David Nieves Presents Work
---

Current MITH Fellow Angel David Nieves presented a paper at the Third Biennial Urban History Association Conference on ASU's Tempe/Phoenix campus. The paper entitled, _"The Struggle" Over Urban Cultural Heritage and Human Rights: Post-Apartheid Museums and Restorative Social Justice in the "New"Ã‚Â South Africa_, introduced some of the broader issues I've been addressing on my work in South Africa. Nieves took advantage of the opportunity to highlight work in progress on his digital project at MITH*--Soweto '76*.
