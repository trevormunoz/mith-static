MARYLAND INSTITUTE FOR TECHNOLOGY IN THE HUMANITIES

**The Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) at the University of Maryland, College Park announces an immediate search for the position of Assistant Director.**

EXEMPT/12 MONTH FULLTIME (POSITION # 112159)

Made possible by a major Challenge Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) is a collaboration among the University of Maryland's College of Arts and Humanities, Libraries, and Office of Information Technology. Since its founding in 1999, MITH has become internationally recognized as one of the leading centers of its kind, distinguished by the cultural diversity so central to its identity.

Located in McKeldin Library at the heart of the campus, MITH is the University's primary intellectual hub for scholars and practitioners of digital humanities, new media, and cyberculture, as well as new home of the Electronic Literature Organization, the most prominent international group devoted to the writing, publishing and reading of electronic literature.

Projects have typically taken the form of electronic editions, scholarly databases, or high-end teaching materials (examples here: ). MITH is also increasingly supporting research in creative new media. MITH's house research includes projects in text mining, visualization, digital libraries, electronic publishing, and digital preservation. We collaborate actively with allied campus units, including the University Libraries, the College of Information Science, and the Human Computer Interaction Lab. Situated just outside of Washington DC, MITH also offers all of the opportunities that come from the libraries, museums, and cultural institutions of the area.

In addition to participating in MITH's house research, the Assistant Director will bear primary responsibility for the conceptualization and development of MITH's Fellows' projects and the supervision of a staff that includes a full-time Web designer, graduate assistants, and interns. We are therefore seeking a data architecture specialist experienced with both relational database and XML data representation. Ability to work at the command-line level with Unix/Linux based applications such as mySql is required, and preference will be given to candidates with scripting and programming expertise. Strong organizational and project management skills are also mandatory, as are excellent communication skills. A humanities background is welcome and desirable. MA, MLS, or Ph.D. preferred.

The Assistant Director is a full-time staff position at the University, with benefits. Salary commensurate with experience, ranging from $50,000-$63,000.

To apply, please send a letter of application, CV, and contact information for three references. Best consideration by August 1, 2006. Application materials may be sent electronically to mith@umd.edu or to Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH, McKeldin Library, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742. Consideration of applications to begin immediately. Applications from women and minorities, as well as faculty at HBCU's is encouraged.
