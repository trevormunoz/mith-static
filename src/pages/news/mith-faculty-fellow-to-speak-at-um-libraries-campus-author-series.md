![Carla Peterson](/assets/images/2012-01-carla-peterson-200x200.jpg)Wednesday, March 7th at 4:30pm Carla Peterson, Ph.D, professor of English, MITH Faculty Fellow, and director of the _[Black Gotham Archive](http://www.blackgothamarchive.org/)_, will be giving a talk as part of the University of Maryland Libraries' _[Speaking of Books... Conversations with Campus Authors](http://www.lib.umd.edu/MCK/booktalks.html)_ series. Carla will be speaking on her recently published book, [_Black Gotham: A Family History of African Americans in Nineteenth-Century New York City_](http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300162554) (Yale UP, 2011).

During the 2011-12 academic year, Dr. Peterson is completing a faculty fellowship at MITH which is allowing her to create the _[Black Gotham Archive](http://www.blackgothamarchive.org/)_, an interactive website that dives into the cultural and narrative history of the lives of nineteenth-century black New Yorkers. Throughout the course of the year, Dr. Peterson is giving book talks across the country. A complete calendar of her events is listed on the [Archive](http://www.blackgothamarchive.org/).

The _Speaking of Books... Conversations with Campus Authors_ series of author talks and signings was begun in 2005 by the University of Maryland Libraries' Humanities Librarians to highlight new and interesting research by faculty members from all schools and colleges at the University of Maryland. These free events are open to all members of the campus community and the general public. Each author will answer questions following his or her talk and sign books, which will be available for purchase. Refreshments will be served.
