This fall's Digital Dialogues are now available with brief descriptions on our MITH Podcasting page. Topics covered this fall include videogame preservation, teaching in Second Life, data mining for metaphors in eighteenth century literature, data sets and an "abundant humanities library", how programming is taught, open source teaching and scholarship, and a close look at Ebook devices.

We have a couple more episodes before wrapping up this season's series on November 17th. If you are unable to attend the live event, the podcast file will be available within a day after the talk.
