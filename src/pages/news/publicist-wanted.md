Word processing is hot and the media is on the trail.

This morning _The New York Times_ Arts Beat blog published ["Who Word-Processed First? Professor's History Has Writers Staking Their Claim](http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/10/who-word-processed-first-professors-history-has-writers-staking-their-claim/?scp=2&sq=matthew%20kirschenbaum&st=cse)" on MITH Associate Director [Matt Kirschenbaum](//mkirschenbaum.wordpress.com/), which covered the early word processing authors who have contacted Matt (several staking their claim in the chronicle of literary word processing) since the _Times_' [previous article on Matt](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/26/books/a-literary-history-of-word-processing.html?scp=1&sq=matthew%20kirschenbaum&st=cse) from December 25, 2011.

Additionally, this morning Matt appeared on _Maryland Morning with Sheilah Kast_, Maryland's NPR station, to discuss his upcoming book[ "Track Changes: A Literary History of Word Processing,"](https://mkirschenbaum.wordpress.com/2011/04/10/track-changes/) set to be published by Harvard University Press in 2013.

Pretty soon we'll have to send out a search for a publicist. Well done, Matt!
