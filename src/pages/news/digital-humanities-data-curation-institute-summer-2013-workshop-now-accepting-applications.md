title: Digital Humanities Data Curation Institute Summer 2013 Workshop Now Accepting
  Applications
---

MITH is pleased to announce that applications are now being accepted for the first Digital Humanities Data Curation Institute workshop, to be held at the Graduate School of Library and Information Science (GSLIS), at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, on June 24-26, 2013. Visit [the Institute Web site](http://www.dhcuration.org/institute/ "Digital Humanities Data Curation") to complete an application.

Digital Humanities Data Curation is a series of workshops organized by [MITH](http://mith.umd.edu/), the [Women Writers Project (WWP)](http://www.wwp.brown.edu/) at [Brown University](http://www.brown.edu/), and the [Center for Informatics Research in Science and Scholarship (CIRSS)](http://cirss.lis.illinois.edu/) at [GSLIS](http://lis.illinois.edu/). The workshop series is generously funded by an [Institute for Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities](http://www.neh.gov/grants/odh/institutes-advanced-topics-in-the-digital-humanities "IATDH") grant from the [National Endowment for the Humanities](http://www.neh.gov "NEH").

These three-day workshops will provide a strong introductory grounding in data curation concepts and practices, focusing on the special issues and challenges of data curation in the digital humanities. Learning will be largely case-based, supplemented by short lectures, guest presentations, and practical exercises. Digital Humanities Data Curation is aimed at humanities researchers — whether traditional faculty or alternative (alt-ac) professionals — as well as librarians, archivists, cultural heritage specialists, other information professionals, and advanced graduate students. All participants will also have access to an online resource for sharing knowledge about data curation for the humanities. This resource will build on material from the existing [DH Curation Guide](http://guide.dhcuration.org/).

The Summer 2013 workshop is the first event in the series. Future workshops will be held at Brown University and the University of Maryland in 2013-14. More information is available at [the Institute Web site](http://www.dhcuration.org/institute/ "Digital Humanities Data Curation").
