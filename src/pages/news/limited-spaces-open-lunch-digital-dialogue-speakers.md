title: Limited Spaces Open for Lunch with Our Digital Dialogue Speakers!
---

As part of our Digital Dialogue series, we are able to offer a small number of spaces for graduate students, staff, and faculty to join our speakers for lunch. This is a great opportunity to engage directly with the speakers and discuss their work in a less formal setting. We are now getting ready for our [Fall 2014 season](http://mith.umd.edu/digital-dialogues/schedule/) and space is limited, so please [fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1NQAUTFovjKygW5o9ne-MEDoMqChnhLYi_L7VM8hQh2Y/viewform?usp=send_form) as soon as possible with your information and speaker preferences.

Any questions can be sent to Stephanie Sapienza at [sapienza@umd.edu](mailto:sapienza@umd.edu).
