title: Please welcome Emily Frazier as MITH's new Research Assistant!
---

MITH is very excited to welcome Emily Frazier to the MITH team, in the role of Graduate Research Assistant on the newly-funded NEH grant project _Broadcasting Audiovisual Data_! Emily is a graduate student in the History and Library Science (HiLS) dual-degree program at UMD's iSchool. Her graduate work focuses on maps and cartography in the Americas, which builds on her undergraduate work in linguistics and Spanish at University of Texas at Austin, where her thesis project centered on creating custom map visualizations to track linguistic data. She enjoys solving information and data 'puzzles' to improve discoverability for collections, a trait that will be extremely useful to the MITH team on this particular project.

[_Broadcasting Audiovisual Data_](https://mith.umd.edu/research/broadcasting-av-data/) is a new initiative funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities to enhance discoverability of institutionally-distributed archival radio collections using a linked open data framework. A partnership between MITH and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the project is an expansion of the previous NEH-funded project [_Unlocking the Airwaves_](https://mith.umd.edu/research/unlocking-the-airwaves/). It will virtually link together four complementary radio collections at UMD Libraries, UW-Madison Libraries, and the University of Minnesota Libraries.

In her role, Emily will create select data visualizations during the final phases of _Unlocking the Airwaves_, before transitioning to the _Broadcasting A/V Data_ project. There will she assist the team with testing and documenting workflows for managing collected archival authority data (data about people and organizations represented in the collections), including reconciliation to outside sources and enhancement. She'll also perform data transformations, and create 'linked open exhibits' from the newly-connected collections.
