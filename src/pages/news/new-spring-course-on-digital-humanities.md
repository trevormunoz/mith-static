title: New Spring Course on Digital Humanities
---

We are delighted to announce that Dr. Doug Reside, Assistant Director of MITH, the Maryland Institute of Technology in the Humanities, will be offering a 3-credit spring course through the English department on the basic applied elements of the programming for the digital humanities.

Participants will learn the basics of HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP, XML, TEI, and MySQL. The goal is to provide attendees with the skills necessary to construct a simple online electronic edition. The course will run from 3:30-6:00 on Tuesdays in the MITH conference room. This is a 400-level course worth 3.0 credits, with GRADUATE STUDENTS as the target audience. You will not find it listed on Testudo. Those interested should send an email to Doug Reside (dreside -at- umd -dot- edu). There are limited seats available, so early registration is advisable.
