MITH is pleased to announce that we will be representing our community-university collaboration with the [The Lakeland Community Heritage Project (LCHP)](https://publicdh.org/case-studies/lakeland-community-heritage-project/) at the 2022 Public Digital Humanities Institute at the Institute for Digital Research in the Humanities (IDRH) at the University of Kansas! Lakeland team members Violetta Sharps-Jones and Stephanie Sapienza will act as instructors at the Institute, which will be held on June 6-11, 2022, at The Hall Center on the KU campus. The purpose of the Institute is to foster successful academic-community collaborations focused on digital, public-facing humanities projects. Applicants will receive training and support in public digital humanities and academic-community collaborations. The LCHP will be one of several case studies used by Institute instructors to highlight a range of platforms and modes of digital scholarship, to provide participants with real-world examples.

There are also two upcoming virtual information sessions tomorrow (Thursday December 2) and Friday December 17 where potential applicants can ask questions or talk in person with select Institute staff. [Interested applicants can register here](https://publicdh.org/info-sessions/).
