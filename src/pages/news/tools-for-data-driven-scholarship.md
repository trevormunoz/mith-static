Later today, MITH and George Mason's Center for History and New Media will kick off a two-day workshop on "[Tools for Data-Driven Scholarship](http://mith.umd.edu/tools/)," sponsored by the NSF, NEH, and IMLS.

An invitational meeting, digital humanities leaders and experts from around the world will convene to discuss future directions in software development, cyberinfrastructure, and services for the arts, humanities, and social sciences. Keynote speakers are Chris Blizzard from Mozilla and Maura Marx, executive director of Knowledge Commons (formerly the Open Content Alliance). A report from the meeting will be issued to the wider community.
