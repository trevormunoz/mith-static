MITH is pleased to report the launching of the [Shakespeare Quartos Archive](http://quartos.org/) by the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington DC and the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford. Funded by a JISC/ NEH Transatlantic Digitization Collaboration Grant, The Shakespeare Quartos Archive provides access to the early rare quarto editions of William Shakespeare's _Hamlet_, a collection that in its physical form is distributed among six geographically distant institutions. In addition to providing unprecedented access, the archive promotes scholarship by enabling users to perform side-by-side text comparisons and full text searches as well as create and affix annotations and tags to content that can be stored for future reference and shared with other users. The Shakespeare Quartos Archive is the result of a cross-Atlantic collaboration between the Maryland Institute of Technology and the six institutions housing these rare holdings.
