title: MITH Awarded Amazon Web Services Grant
---

We are pleased to announce that MITH has been awarded an [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/) research grant for \$7,500 to support our use of cloud computing services over the next two years. We are currently using Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances to perform natural language processing tasks on large text corpora, including a collection of approximately 117,000 books from the [HathiTrust](http://www.hathitrust.org/) that spans four centuries and several languages. Our EC2 instances also support development at MITH, host prototype applications, and archive MITHâ€™s activity in social media channels. This generous award from Amazon will allow us to expand all of these operations. Please follow the MITH blog for an upcoming series of more detailed posts about how we are using these cloud computing services to enable digital humanities research.
