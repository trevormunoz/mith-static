title: Introducing TILE 0.9
---

We’re excited to announce the redesigned website for and public release of [The Text-Image Linking Environment (TILE)](http://mith.umd.edu/tile/), a web-based tool for creating and editing image-based electronic editions and digital archives of humanities texts. This initial release of TILE 0.9 features tools for importing and exporting transcript lines and images of text, an image markup tool, a semi-automated line recognizer that tags regions of text within an image, and plugin architecture to extend the functionality of the software.

There are a number of ways to try TILE 0.9 and learn more. You can visit the MITH-hosted [sandbox](http://mith.umd.edu/tile/sandbox/) version that allows you to use the tool online, or download a customizable version of the software.

If you’d like to learn more, we’ve made end-user and developer [documentation](http://mith.umd.edu/tile/documentation/) available, and we’re ready to answer your questions on our [forums](http://web.archive.org/web/20111203155024/http://mith.umd.edu:80/tile/forums/?).

Supported by an NEH Preservation and Access Grant, TILE is a collaboration between the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (Doug Reside, Dave Lester) and Indiana University (Dot Porter, John Walsh).
