This week MITH is hosting CorporaCamp, the first three-day Corpora Space workshop. The event brings together scholars and software developers from the Universities of Maryland, Chicago, Illinois and Wisconsin, as well as Northwestern, Tufts, Georgetown, and Google. During the next three days we will be building a prototype application which works across three corpora - [TCP EEBO & ECCO](http://www.lib.umich.edu/tcp/), [HathiTrus](http://www.hathitrust.org/home)t, and [Perseus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/). This effort will start to realize some of the goals of the Corpora Space design process, and raise some key questions about scholarly research on large structured collections of digital texts.

More detailed information about our process, [goals and outcomes](https://wiki.projectbamboo.org/display/BTECH/Corpora+Camp+Workshop+outcomes+and+goals) is available on the project wiki. So watch this blog and follow us on Twitter via the [#corcamp](http://twitter.com/#corcamp) hashtag, as we get down to work on ‘Woodchipper’. And no, it has nothing to do with _Fargo._
