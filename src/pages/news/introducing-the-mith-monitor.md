In the past, I’ve taken this opportunity to review some of the highlights from the previous year and provide a few coming attractions. This year, however, we are beginning a new tradition. There are so many things to report that we’ve created the _MITH Monitor_ to report them to you in several installments throughout the year. Although the _MITH Monitor_ will exist primarily as hard copy, we are also publishing it electronically at [mith.umd.edu/monitor](http://web.archive.org/web/20151223191158/http://mith.umd.edu/monitor/). I invite you to view it online.

We look forward to seeing you during the upcoming semester. The first [Digital Dialogue](http://mith.umd.edu/podcast/) is scheduled for September 20th!
