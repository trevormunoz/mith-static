title: 'Podcasts for MITH Digital Dialogues: Now with captions!'
---

In an attempt to make our Digital Dialogues podcast videos more accessible, MITH has begun to add captions to the videos on our [Vimeo site](https://vimeo.com/mithinmd). All previous podcast videos prior to the current season currently have captions, and as we move into the Fall 2014 season we will be adding them as we get them back from our vendor, [Amara](http://www.amara.org/en/).

You can either access the podcasts [through our website](http://mith.umd.edu/digital-dialogues/dialogues/) (accessible from each individual podcast page), or by accessing the [MITH Vimeo site](https://vimeo.com/mithinmd) directly. To turn on the captions, click on the small blue ‘CC’ icon on the bottom right side of the screen and click on the ‘English CC.’
