title: MITH Faculty Fellow Answers Readers' Questions on Times’ “Taking Questions”
---

Carla Peterson, professor of English and a MITH Faculty Fellow, is being featured this week by [The New York Times City Room "Taking Questions" series ](http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/13/taking-questions-carla-l-peterson/)on her recent book, [_Black Gotham: A Family History of African Americans in Nineteenth-Century New York City_](http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300162554) (Yale University Press, 2011). _Black Gotham_ is a riveting account of Peterson's quest to reconstruct the lives of her nineteenth-century ancestors. As she shares their stories and those of their friends, neighbors, and business associates, she illuminates the wider history of African-American elites in New York City. Readers may submit their questions to Dr. Peterson about nineteenth-century black New York on the ["Taking Questions"](http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/13/taking-questions-carla-l-peterson/#postComment) page, and she will respond in subsequent posts.

During her current MITH faculty fellowship, Peterson is creating the [Black Gotham Archive](http://www.blackgothamarchive.org/), a dynamic website based upon her book, _Black Gotham_. The site chronicles the visual and textual history of Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, and links this information to interactive maps, in order to create a deeper understanding of nineteenth-century black New Yorkers.

Additionally, this Sunday Dr. Peterson will be giving book talks at [St. Philip's Episcopal Church](http://www.stphilipsharlem.org/) in Harlem and at the Lower East Side[ Tenement Museum](http://www.tenement.org/vizcenter_events.php) on February 29. Please visit the [Black Gotham Archive](http://www.blackgothamarchive.org/) for a schedule of full events.
