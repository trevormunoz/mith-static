MITH Associate Director and Associate Professor of English **MATTHEW KIRSCHENBAUM** has the cover story in this week's edition of the _Chronicle Review_ in the _Chronicle of Higher Education_ with an essay entitled "[Hamlet.doc? Literature in a Digital Age](http://web.archive.org/web/20090716182737/http://chronicle.com/free/v53/i50/50b00801.htm)."

The essay discusses the challenges and opportunities for the future of literary studies in an era when the material basis of authorship---including journals, notes, correspondence, and manuscripts---is increasingly born-digital.
