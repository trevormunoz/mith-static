---

MITH is pleased to release its [Spring Speakers Schedule](http://web.archive.org/web/20100609001120/http://mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_spring_2006.pdf). Between our weekly seminar series Digital Dialogues and a variety of special guests we are bringing to campus in partnership with other campus units, we are able to offer speakers and events in the digital humanities _every week_ of the spring semester.

Alongside of showcasing a diverse array of current research by MITH's Fellows and College Park faculty, MITH will host or co-host talks by such distinguished visitors as **Jerome McGann** and **Johanna Drucker** (University of Virginia), **Alan Liu** (UCSB), **Joseph Tabbi** (UIC), **Scott Rettberg** (Richard Stockton College, and co-Founder of the Electronic Literature Organization), **Shelley Jackson** (author of _Patchwork Girl_ and _Skin_), and **Scott McCloud** (author of _Understanding Comics_ and _Reinventing Comics_).

Unless otherwise noted, all talks are Tuesdays at 12:30 in the MITH Conference Room and are free and open to the public.
