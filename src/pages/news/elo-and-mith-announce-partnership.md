At [today's MLA event](http://www.eliterature.org/2005/12/e-lit-and-new-media-happy-hour-at-mla/) the [Electronic Literature Organization](http://www.eliterature.org) and the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities announced that we have agreed on the principles of a wide-ranging partnership. Plans in the works include research projects, conferences, and a move of the main ELO office to MITH in mid-2006 (while the UCLA ELO node will continue to organize its highly successful events). A joint press release will follow in the new year.
