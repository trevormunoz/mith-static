Our Bootcamp is continuing into its second day.

This morning we broke up into two main hacker groups: those interested in Annotation tools and those interested in creating a (better) text editing tools. Due to my work with OAC, I'm in the Annotation group discussing ideas about an annotation tool. I've started hacking up some code using MITHGrid to create a front-end application that will work with storing OAC-specification-friendly annotations to an online microservice. Our service that we're making in this group has a lot of the same goals as things like Zotero, but in this case we want to experiment more and come up with solutions to specific problems such as how to store and display multiple annotation bodies for one target, and what issues need to be addressed for a user interface that does this. There are some great people in my group, among them Mortiz Wissenbach, Marco Petris, and Asaf Bartov from Wikimedia.

I'll be making updates regularly, but you can check out my code that I'm writing on my Github: <http://github.com/jdickie>.

The other main group is focusing on developing ideas and apps for creating a new text editor for editing marked up documents. Their main issue is in displaying overlapping annotations and updating them while the marked up document is being edited (e.g. shifting annotation positions when new text is added, but retaining the overall meaning of the annotation). Gregor Middell from the Faust Edition project and Nick Laiaconafrom NINES are among those working on this, so I'm certain there'll be something great coming out of that group.

Forgot to mention yesterday that you can follow the live notes of Interedition Bootcamp Wuerzburg here: <http://interedition.eu/wiki/index.php/W%C3%BCrzburg2011/Live_Minutes>
