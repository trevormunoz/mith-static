title: MITH announces first courses ever for spring 2017!
---

MITH is thrilled to announce that we will be offering two courses in the spring as part of the new interdisciplinary Graduate Certificate [Digital Studies in the Arts and Humanities (DSAH)](http://dsah.umd.edu/). Designed to allow graduate students to explore traditional humanities concepts alongside forms of digital media and computational tools and techniques, DSAH offers students a unique chance to bolster their traditional humanistic disciplines with complementary digital technologies.

The certificate consists of [15 credits](http://dsah.umd.edu/requirements/), with two courses and four credits offered starting in the spring of 2016, under the MITH course prefix. The courses are:

**MITH 610 : Introduction to Digital Studies** _3 credits_ Tuesdays 3:30 pm - 6:00 pm This course is required for students intending to pursue the Digital Studies in the Arts and Humanities Graduate Certificate; it is open to all, however. It is designed to introduce you to current topics and critical issues in this diverse, complex, and rapidly changing field, with a special emphasis on approaches to Digital Studies as practiced by here at UMD. The course will combine readings and an overview of key topics and methodologies with hands-on workshops, critical discussion, guest speakers (both from campus and elsewhere), and site visits to relevant destinations. Examples of topical areas to be covered include Data Mining the Social Web, Reimagining the Archive, Digital Aesthetics/Digital Play, and Global Digital Identities. Evaluation will be based on weekly exercises, class participation, presentations, and a written reflective essay. No special skills are required or assumed other than a willingness to experiment and learn. **MITH 729 : Colloquium in Digital Studies** _1 credit_ Selected Fridays, 3:00 pm - 5:00 pm Readings, discussion, site visits, visiting speakers, and workshops on topics of interest to the colloquium's participants. Our current theme: Trackings and Tracings.

Students with questions about these courses should contact the Program Director Matthew Kirschenbaum, at [dsah@umd.edu](mailto:dsah@umd.edu).
