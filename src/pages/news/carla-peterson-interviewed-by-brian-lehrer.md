title: Carla Peterson Interviewed by Brian Lehrer
---

On Monday, April 9th [CUNY TV show host Brian Lehrer](http://www.cuny.tv/show/brianlehrer) will interview Carla Peterson on her book, _Black Gotham: A Family History of African Americans in Nineteenth-Century New York City_ (Yale University Press, 2011) and the [Black Gotham Digital Archive](http://www.blackgothamarchive.org/).

_Black Gotham_ is a riveting account of Petersonâ€™s quest to reconstruct the lives of her nineteenth-century ancestors. As she shares their stories and those of their friends, neighbors, and business associates, she illuminates the wider history of African-American elites in New York City.

During her current MITH faculty fellowship, Peterson is creating the [Black Gotham Digital Archive](http://www.blackgothamarchive.org/), a dynamic website based upon her book. The site chronicles the visual and textual history of Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, and links this information to interactive maps in order to create a deeper understanding of nineteenth-century black New Yorkers.
