title: Fall 2006 Digital Dialogues Schedule
---

What's the role of mobile phones in the digital humanities? How do we archive the cultural and corporate history of the dot com era? What's the edge of the edge in the digital arts these days? Why would you want to consult an encyclopedia that would have you as a contributor? Check out MITH's [Fall 2006 Digital Dialogues](http://web.archive.org/web/20100608224354/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2006.pdf) schedule, which will bring you a lunchtime seminar on all of these topics and much more, every Tuesday at 12:30 in MITH's conference room with guests from UMD and far beyond.

With all events free and open to the public, Digital Dialogues are a superb way of plugging in to what's happening around campus, and in the much wider world of the digital arts and humanities.
