The Digital Humanities Winter Institute is pleased to announce that the City University of New York (CUNY) [Graduate Center Digital Initiatives Program](http://gcdi.commons.gc.cuny.edu) has joined as a sponsor of the January 2013 event. Part of a constellation of DH efforts at CUNY that includes the CUNY Academic Commons and the CUNY Digital Humanities Initiative, CUNY GCDI will support CUNY faculty, staff, and students attending DHWI to increase their knowledge of digital humanities through any of the eight courses being offered. Current faculty, staff, and students from CUNY should contact [Matthew K. Gold](mailto:mgold@gc.cuny.edu) for information on CUNY-specific scholarships.

As part of its sponsorship, the CUNY Graduate Center Digital Initiatives Program will also support a special graduate student networking event open to all DHWI graduate students on the first night of the Institute which will allow young scholars to engage with one another, discuss issues of concern in DH, and speak with leading digital humanists and instructors. For more information on DHWI and this special event, please visit the Institute [homepage](http://www.mith.umd.edu/dhwi).
