title: Announcing TWO events in April with Andy van Dam from Brown University!
---

MITH is very pleased to announce two upcoming events in late April featuring renowned Computer Science and Technology professor Andy van Dam. The first event, on **[Monday April 25th at 7:30pm](http://mith.umd.edu/research/computer-science-and-the-humanities/),** will be a screening of the 1974 Documentary _Hypertext: An Educational Experiment in English and Computer Science at Brown University_, followed by a panel discussion with van Dam, UMD professors, and representatives from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The panel will focus on both historical and current collaborations between Computer Science and the Humanities, with a discussion of the 1974 NEH-funded project featured in the documentary.

The second event, on **[Tuesday April 26th at 12:30pm](http://mith.umd.edu/dialogues/dd-spring-2016-andy-van-dam/),** will be a special addition to our Spring 2016 Digital Dialogues series, with van Dam presenting a talk entitled "Five Decades of Experiments with Hypermedia Systems for the Humanities."

We are very excited to be hosting these two events, and hope to see many of you there!
