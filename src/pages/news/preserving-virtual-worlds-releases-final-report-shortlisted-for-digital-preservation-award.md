Two exciting news items from the [Preserving Virtual Worlds](http://web.archive.org/web/20150709192456/http://pvw.illinois.edu:80/pvw/) project, where MITH has been a partner alongside of the University of Illinois, Stanford University, and the Rochester Institute of Technology, as well as Linden Lab, creators of Second Life.

The project has released its [final report](https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/17097), 195 pages detailing two years worth of findings from our research, including such topics as emulation, virtualization, migration, archival description, collections policy, hardware stemmatics, Rosetta computing, and disk image forensics.
