  "From Digital Humanities to Neuroscience to Speculative Realism: A Day in the
  Reading Life of Neil Fraistat"

Our own Neil Fraistat, MITH Director, is featured in today’s The Chronicle of Higher Education _[Daily Read ](http://chronicle.com/blogs/pageview/my-daily-read-neil-fraistat/30055)\_column. While Neil finds food for thought in _[The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/)_’s investigative profiles, and brilliant digital humanities scholarship in Kathleen Fitzgerald’s _[Planned Obsolescence](http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/)_, he still manages to keep his sense of humor by reading \_The Onion_ and his son and daughter’s joint blog, [Sibling & Charybdis: Two Siblings Who Love the Funny](https://siblingandcharybdis.wordpress.com/).
