I am pleased to say that with a lot of work on a lot of people’s part, there is now a[ live demo of the Digital Mishnah Project](http://www.digitalmishnah.org/demo/). The demo is just that: a demonstration of possible functionalities.This post will outline some of the features that were always meant to be temporary and some new planned or desired features, and then invite comments.

### What will be changed

- The selection of witnesses. Entering numerals is unwieldy. Ideally, users should be able to slide text “icons” around (as one does with a pivot table in Excel, for instance)
- Output in browse functions. A single chapter was used for the demo version. Future versions will allow users to select specific chapters and/or specific ms pages and progress by page or chapter. Metadata should perhaps be hideable.
- Output in collate functions. The demo groups output together; these are actually alternative functions.

### Additional basic functionalities

- Ability to download or print results.
- Ability to compare longer texts (whole chapters)
- Improved collation–and/or the ability to select alternative collation methods

### Desiderata

- Statistical tools, such as multi-dimensional scaling and clustering, to group manuscripts and display results
- Since there will inevitably be errors in collation, ability to correct alignment and re-run various operations
- Dynamic synoptic view, in which two or more witnesses can be viewed in parallel columns, with the ability to highlight textual differences or other features.
