title: Assessing Interest in a DH/DS Student Organization
---

Students who do digital humanities at the University of Maryland are spread across many different organizational positions and unitsâ€”just like the faculty, librarians, and staff with whom they take courses and collaborate on research. At MITH we are always looking for ways to help folks connect with others who are doing similar work. So, we would like to know if perhaps now is a good time to encourage the formation of an official student organization on our campus for those interested in digital humanities or digital studies.

If you are a UMD student, we want to hear from you! Please take our [brief survey](https://umdsurvey.umd.edu/jfe/form/SV_aVLttIc1jw6WKxL).

This survey is intended to help us gauge interest in the creation of a [student organization](http://thestamp.umd.edu/student_org_resource_center_sorc/registration/registration_requirements) for those both curious about or active in the digital humanities. This group would be run by students and could be a forum through which they might network and build connections, stay informed about DH on campus, and also elect representatives to participate in the shared governance of DH organizations on campus, such as MITH.
