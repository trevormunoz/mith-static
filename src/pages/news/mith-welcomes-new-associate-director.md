The [University of Maryland Libraries](http://www.lib.umd.edu/) and the [Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities](http://mith.umd.edu/) are very pleased to announce the joint appointment of Trevor Muñoz as an Assistant Dean of the Libraries for Digital Humanities Research and an Associate Director of MITH.

Trevor Muñoz holds an MA (with distinction) in Digital Humanities from [King’s College, London](http://www.kcl.ac.uk), and has just completed his MS in Library and Information Science, with a concentration in Data Curation, from the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](http://illinois.edu)---the number-one Masters programs in each of their respective fields. He also holds a BA, _cum laude_, from [Harvard University](http://www.harvard.edu).

He is currently employed as a research assistant and co-editor for the [University of Illinois’s Data Education Program for the Humanities](http://web.archive.org/web/20141229015210/http://cirss.lis.illinois.edu:80/CollMeta/dcep.html), an IMLS-funded project to build expertise in humanities data curation, and is leading development of a collaboratively authored online guide to best practices in humanities data curation. He has also worked as an intern in data curation at [Brown University](http://www.brown.edu), and on a range of digital humanities projects at Illinois.

Trevor comes to MITH and the Libraries at a moment when the issues and challenges around humanities data curation, especially for large-scale data-intensive humanities research projects, are increasingly paramount. As his educational background indicates, he will bring to Maryland some of the most recent, cutting-edge research and expertise in this rapidly emerging area. In his joint capacity, Trevor will be developing a series of initiatives on behalf of both MITH and the Libraries to ensure the long-term care and preservation of digital humanities collections and scholarship. He will also be instrumental in developing digital humanities research strategies for the Libraries, and will work to bring MITH and the Libraries further together in joint research ventures.

According to MITH Director Neil Fraistat, “Trevor’s appointment opens exciting new opportunities for collaboration between MITH and the Libraries beyond adding a crucial area of expertise to MITH’s staff.”

According to Patricia Steele, the Dean of University of Maryland Libraries, “This new partnership with MITH promises to bring us closer together in developing new models to serve scholars today and tomorrow. We are very energized by Trevor's appointment and the prospects he brings to the University of Maryland.”

Babak Hamidzadeh, Associate Dean of Information Technology & Digital Initiatives at the University of Maryland Libraries believes that Trevor’s appointment will advance the state of the art of digital libraries and archives in Maryland and beyond, by creating opportunities to engage MITH and other academic faculty at the University of Maryland with the faculty and staff at the University of Maryland Libraries.
