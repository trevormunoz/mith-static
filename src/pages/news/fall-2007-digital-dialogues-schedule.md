The [Fall 2007 MITH Digital Dialogues](http://web.archive.org/web/20100615144449/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2007.pdf) schedule is now available (PDF). As always, [Digital Dialogues](http://web.archive.org/web/20100606123909/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/digitaldialogue/index.php) are Tuesdays at 12:30 in the MITH conference room (McKeldin Library). We especially like seeing visitors from our neighboring campuses around town.

We have a terrific line-up this semester, with local UMD talent (**JONATHAN AUERBACH**, **MARTHA NELL SMITH**, **TANYA CLEMENT**, **JOSEPH JAJA**, **PHILIP RESNIK**) presenting their current research on topics as diverse as digital tools for not-reading a famously unreadable book to the computational linguistics of "spin" to early cinema as new media to digital archiving and preservation.

We also have a number of distinguished visitors from off campus, coming from places like the Smithsonian, IBM, the Internet Archive, and the NEH. Come drop by for a fireside chat with **BRETT BOBLEY** about the NEH's new Digital Humanities Initiative, or hear the University of Georgia's **DAVID SALTZ** talk about "simulating liveness" in his Virtual Vaudeville project and in Second Life; or hear **CHRIS FUNKHOUSER **on why electronic poetry is like Scrabble. Plus much, much more.

We look forward to seeing you on Tuesday, September the 11 at 12:30 for our first event, with Tanya Clement on "Using Digital Tools to Not-Read Gertrude Stein's The Making of Americans."
