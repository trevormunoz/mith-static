The TILE team is pleased to announce the release of version 1.0. The [Text-Image Linking Environment](http://mith.umd.edu/tile/) (TILE) is a web-based tool for creating and editing image-based electronic editions and digital archives of humanities texts. This version of TILE includes:

- Import/export of TEI P5, and the ability to easily create custom data importers
- Improved workflow and accuracy using the Auto Line Recognizer (ALR)
- An improved API for plugin developers
- Enhancements and bug fixes to TILE's interface
- Detailed [release notes](http://mith.umd.edu/tile/2011/07/21/tile-1-0-release/) for more information

A MITH-hosted [sandbox version](http://mith.umd.edu/tile/sandbox/) of TILE allows you to test the tool online without installing it on your machine. We encourage users to [download a copy](https://github.com/umd-mith/TILE/zipball/v1.0) to install on their own servers to customize the tool. Users can import their own data into the software, or get started by playing with pre-loaded data of Algernon Swinburne's poem Anactoria, provided by John Walsh at Indiana University.

The development of TILE has been supported by an NEH Preservation and Access Grant, and it is a collaboration between the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (Dave Lester, Grant Dickie, Jim Smith, Doug Reside) and Indiana University (Dot Porter, John Walsh, Jeffrey Mudge, Tim Bowman). We'd love to hear how you are using TILE, and what questions or suggestions you have, either in blog comments or on the [TILE forums](http://web.archive.org/web/20111203155024/http://mith.umd.edu:80/tile/forums/?).
