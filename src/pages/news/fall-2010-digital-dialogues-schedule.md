title: Fall 2010 Digital Dialogues Schedule

The Fall 2010 MITH Digital Dialogues [schedule is now available](http://web.archive.org/web/20111121205902/http://mith.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2010.pdf) (PDF). As always, Digital Dialogues are Tuesdays at 12:30 in the MITH conference room (McKeldin Library). We especially like seeing visitors from our neighboring campuses around town.

Neil Fraistat, Director of MITH, comments, "Digital Dialogues has long been one of MITH's signature programs, providing a venue for the digital humanities community on campus and in the greater Washington, D.C. area to engage with some of the most important ideas and distinguished scholars in the field. This Fall's schedule, organized by MITH's assistant director Dave Lester, varies our usual format by including hands on workshops. It also introduces to the MITH community the work of our three splendid new colleagues: Hasan Elahi, Jason Farman, and Tara Rodgers."

We hope to see many of you on Tuesday, September 14 at 12:30 for our first event, with Zeynep Tufekci and Nathan Jurgenson, entitled, "The iPad: The ‘Jesus Tablet’ and the Resurrection of Consumer Society."
