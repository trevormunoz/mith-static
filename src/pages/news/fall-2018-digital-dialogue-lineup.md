## Fall Mixer

Doing digital scholarly work, or curious about the digital humanities and related digital studies? Join us for the Fall 2018 MITH Mixer, Wednesday, September 12 at 12:30 at MITH.

This is a chance to meet others on campus who are interested in digital scholarly work and share your research interests, as well as to meet MITH staff and see our space. We especially encourage graduate students, librarians, and faculty to attend and give a brief lightning talk about their research interests—whether you’ve just begun thinking about some topic, or are further along on a project. **Each presenter will get a maximum of two minutes and 1 slide (or webpage)** so use this as an opportunity to introduce yourself, spark a conversation, or get a new idea out into the world.

If you are interested in giving a lightning talk, please fill out [our survey](https://goo.gl/forms/HPZBITcpZuyBHSXx1) by 6:00 pm on Tuesday, September 11.

Light refreshments will be provided.

_Digital Dialogues is MITH’s signature events program, held during the academic year, and is an occasion for discussion, presentation and intellectual exchange that you can build into your schedule._
