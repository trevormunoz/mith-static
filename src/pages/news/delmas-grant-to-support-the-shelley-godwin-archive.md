title: Delmas Grant to Support the Shelley-Godwin Archive
---

MITH is pleased to announce the receipt of a generous grant from [The Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation](http://www.delmas.org/) to support our work on the _[Shelley-Godwin Archive,](http://www.shelleygodwinarchive.org)_ under the supervision of MITH Director and Shelley scholar, Neil Fraistat.

[![](/assets/images/2014-02-sga_screenshot_sm.jpg "Home Page of The Shelley-Godwin Archive")](http://www.shelleygodwinarchive.org)A recent recipient of a three-year grant from [NEH’s division of Preservation and Access](http://www.neh.gov/grants/guidelines/Collections_and_Resources.html), the* Shelley-Godwin Archive* will contain in digital form all available manuscripts and first editions of Mary Wollstonecraft, William Godwin, Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley. This single family--Mary Shelley was the daughter of Godwin and Wollstonecraft, and the wife of Percy Bysshe--embodies an archetype of British Romanticism: all four struggled in their writings and lives to change the world. Their most important works--Wollstonecraft’s _Vindication of the Rights of Woman_, Godwin’s _Enquiry Concerning Political Justice_, P.B. Shelley’s _Queen Mab_, and _Prometheus Unbound_, and Mary Shelley’s _Frankenstein_--received very different degrees of acclaim in their authors’ lifetimes. All, however, have had lasting and profound effects on international culture.

MITH is partnering in this work with the [Bodleian Libraries](http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/) of University of Oxford, the [Huntington Library](http://www.huntington.org/), the [Houghton Library](http://hcl.harvard.edu/libraries/houghton/) of Harvard College, the [British Library](http://www.bl.uk/), and the Carl H. Pforzheimer Collection of Shelley and His Circle at the [New York Public Library](http://www.nypl.org/), which together hold more than an estimated 90% of the known manuscripts. The project aims to create an innovative archival framework constituting a new model of best practices for research libraries wishing to make freely available to the public their manuscript and print holdings. During the three-year initial phase of the project, the project will be including the nearly thirty known Percy Shelley notebooks and his major philosophical poem, _Queen Mab_, with his extensive reworking; all of the manuscripts for and the first three editions of Mary Shelley’s _Frankenstein_, along with the first two volumes of Mary Shelley’s journals; the manuscripts of two novels by William Godwin, _Fleetwood_ and _Cloudesley_; and the ten volumes of _Shelley and his Circle_ with their invaluable research and all the manuscripts contained in those volumes.

[The Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation](http://www.delmas.org/) will be supporting the work of a team of encoding specialists to begin work on the* Shelley-Godwin Archive \_materials beginning in January 2012. On behalf of the* Shelley-Godwin Archive\_ partners, MITH would like to thank the Delmas Foundation for their generous support.
