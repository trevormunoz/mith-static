title: Registration Open for the Future of Electronic Literature
---

Registration is now open for the Electronic Literature Organization and MITH's May 3rd public symposium on [The Future of Electronic Literature](http://mith.umd.edu/research/future-of-electronic-literature-symposium/). Keynotes are **N. Katherine Hayles** (UCLA) and **Kenneth Thibodeau** (National Archives), but that's just the beginning of the list of terrific people who will be in attendance.

Registration is free for University of Maryland students, staff and faculty, but all attendees must still register. Space is limited, so reserve early!
