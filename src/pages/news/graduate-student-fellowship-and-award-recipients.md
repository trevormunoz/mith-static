MITH is delighted to announce the award winners of our Winnemore Scholarship and Travel Grants for 2005-2006, who were recently selected by a committee on which Katie King, Jo Paoletti, and Martha Nell Smith joined me and MITH's Acting Associate Directors, Matt Kirschenbaum and Carl Stahmer.

The winner of MITH's Winnemore Dissertation Scholarship is Michele Mason, from the Department of Communication. Michele will be producing this Spring a scholarly electronic edition of several key texts by Civil Rights leader Nannie Helen Burroughs, highlighting her influence as a leader of African-American women, a political organizer, and a columnist in the African-American press.

The winners of MITH's \$1,000 graduate student travel grants for conference presentations concerning New Media or the Digital Humanities are Asim Ali (American Studies), Sylvia Mejia (Comparative Literature), Marc Ruppel (English), and co-presenters, Kimberlee Staking and Nikki Ayana Stewart( Women Studies).

I hope you'll join me in congratulating these outstanding graduate students.
