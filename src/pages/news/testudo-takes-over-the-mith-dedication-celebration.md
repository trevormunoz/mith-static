title: Testudo takes over the MITH Dedication Celebration
---

Yesterday (September 5th), we celebrated the dedication of our new space in Hornbake Library. Celebrating with us was a very special guest: [Testudo](http://www.umd.edu/testudo.html "All About Testudo")! Below you will find a gallery of attendee portraits with Testudo, as well as a picture of the beloved mascot reading [Deena Larsen's](http://mith.umd.edu/larsen/ "The Deena Larsen Collection") _Marble Springs_!

[Travis Brown](http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/travis-brown/ "Travis Brown") has posted additional photos (including some _without_ Testudo) [to Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/travisbrown/sets/72157631427840226/with/7939890054/ "Travis Brown's Flickr page").
