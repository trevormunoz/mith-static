Inaugural Class of National Digital Stewardship Residents Selected The Library of Congress, in partnership with the Institute of Museum and Library Services, has selected 10 candidates for the inaugural class of the National Digital Stewardship Residency (NDSR) program. The nine-month program begins in September 2013.

The NDSR program offers recent master’s program graduates in specialized fields— library science, information science, museum studies, archival studies and related technology— the opportunity to gain valuable professional experience in digital preservation. Residents will attend an intensive two-week digital stewardship workshop this fall at the Library of Congress. They will then work on a specialized project at one of 10 host institutions in the Washington, D.C. area, including the Library of Congress. These projects will allow them to acquire hands-on knowledge and skills regarding collection, selection, management, long-term preservation and accessibility of digital assets.

The residents listed below were selected by an expert committee of Library of Congress and Institute of Museum and Library Services staff, with commentary from each host institution.
