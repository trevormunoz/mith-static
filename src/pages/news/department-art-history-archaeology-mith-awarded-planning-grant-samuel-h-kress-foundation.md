title: Department of Art History and Archaeology and MITH Awarded Planning Grant
---

The Department of Art History and Archaeology and the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) are pleased to announce a grant from the Samuel H. Kress Foundation in support of a planning meeting for a major symposium entitled [Art History in Digital Dimensions](https://mith.umd.edu/research/art-history-digital-dimensions/), to be held in College Park and Washington, DC in the fall, 2015. The Steering Committee for the symposium, which includes faculty and students from the University of Maryland and distinguished international scholars in art history and the digital humanities, will be meeting in November, 2014, to determine the agenda of the symposium. A key goal of this initiative is to develop and publicize principles and practical guidelines for the future of graduate training in the digital humanities, art history, and museology, and to consider these in light of such themes as cultural rights/human rights, and scholarly and artistic practice in a collaborative context. Events at the symposium will be guided by principles established at the planning meeting that address critical issues for art history in the digital world and in the public sphere. This initiative builds on the Kress Foundation’s impressive record in the sphere of digital art history.

The planning meeting will take place on November 19 – 20, 2014, in the Michelle Smith Collaboratory for Visual Culture in the Department of Art History and Archaeology.

Gill, Chair, Department of Art History and Archaeology ([mgill@umd.edu](mailto:mgill@umd.edu)) and Neil Fraistat, Director, Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities ([fraistat@umd.edu](mailto:fraistat@umd.edu)).
