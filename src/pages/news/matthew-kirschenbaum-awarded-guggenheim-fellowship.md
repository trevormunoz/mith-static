We are delighted to congratulate MITH Associate Director, Matthew Kirschenbaum on his recent selection as a Guggenheim Fellow for 2011. The John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowships are “intended for men and women who have already demonstrated exceptional capacity for productive scholarship or exceptional creative ability in the arts.” Matt has received the fellowship for his work, “Track Changes: Authorship, Archives, and Literary Culture after Word Processing.”

Please join MITH and the MITH Community in congratulating Matt on this prestigious award, which marks his successful work in digital humanities, electronic literature, virtual worlds, serious games and simulations, textual studies, and postmodern/experimental literature.
