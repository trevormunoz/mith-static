MITH will be moving from its current location on the McKeldin Mall to the Hornbake Library Building in the coming weeks. We anticipate being closed to walk in business beginning July 30th and plan to reopen in our new space (0301 Hornbake Library inside Non-Print Media) on Monday, August 6th.

Please stay tuned for forthcoming invitation to our space dedication in September.
