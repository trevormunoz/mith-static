title: MITH and DH in the News and in the World
---

There has been so much recent activity at MITH that we'd like to take a moment and share a brief digest of MITH in the news and in the world.

- Two weeks ago, Penn State University was host to the [Society for Textual Scholarship 2011 International Conference](http://textualsociety.org/) for which. MITH’s Associate Director Matthew Kirschenbaum served as Program Chair. The event was well received by those who attended and garnered much [attention and discussion on Twitter](http://twapperkeeper.com/hashtag/sts11). As the end of STS11 coincided with the recent [Day of Digital Humanities](http://tapor.ualberta.ca/taporwiki/index.php/Day_in_the_Life_of_the_Digital_Humanities_2011), Matt used the opportunity to blog his “day” in a post entitled, [“STS11: DH and/as Textual Scholarship”](http://ra.tapor.ualberta.ca/~dayofdh2011/matthewkirschenbaum/2011/03/19/sts11-dh-andas-textual-scholarship/).

* MITH's Software Architect, Jim Smith, participated last week in the [Open Annotation Collaboration Phase II Workshop](http://openannotation.org/phaseIIworkshop.html) in Chicago on March 24 and 25. Funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, OAC Phase II represents the next step in MITH's [development of specialized tools devoted to scholarly annotation services](http://mith.umd.edu/research/oac/) on the web .

- Following his success in running a groundbreaking [conference devoted to Application Programming Interfaces](http://mith.umd.edu/apiworkshop/) recently hosted by MITH, Assistant Director Dave Lester participated last week in a National Digital Humanities "Conversation on Communities, Conferences, and Centers" sponsored by the National Institute for Technology in Liberal Education (NITLE). NITLE has [archived a recording of this event](http://www.nitle.org/live/events/122-joining-the-national-digital-humanities) for those who are interested in “ joining the national (and international) conversation on the digital humanities." A stellar cast of digital humanities scholars including, Jentery Sayers and Jason Jones, joined Dave for this discussion.

* Dave Lester is also currently away from MITH in order to participate in a two-day code sprint at Indiana University along with MITH Web Programmer, Grant Dickie, and Jim Smith. They join our IU colleagues to further develop the [Text-Image Linking Environment (TILE) project](http://mith.umd.edu/tile/).

- If all this activity isn't enough, on Saturday, April 2 several members of the MITH team, led by Director Neil Fraistat, will be headed to Oxford for a meeting of the Coalition of Humanities and Art Infrastructures and Networks - [CHAIN](http://www.arts-humanities.net/chain).

* A little closer to home, please be reminded of our wonderful [Digital Dialogue series](http://mith.umd.edu/podcast/) that will feature MITH staff as presenters in the coming weeks: [March 29 – Travis Brown](http://mith.umd.edu/329-mith-digital-dialogue-travis-brown-teaching-machines-to-read-milton-natural-language-processing-challenges-for-literary-and-historical-texts/), April 19 – Seth Denbo and Neil Fraistat, and April 26, Jim Smith.

We have been closely following Patricia Cohen's [coverage of the digital humanities in the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/22/books/digital-humanities-boots-up-on-some-campuses.html?_r=1) and were happy to receive see mention in a recent article of a past MITH project, the [Soweto '76 Archive](http://mith.umd.edu/research/soweto-76-a-living-digital-archive/). Please continue to follow us here, [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/umd_mith) and [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Maryland-Institute-for-Technology-in-the-Humanities/121630257870631) for more news of MITH and digital humanities in the world.
