The MITH barn raising finished last week with resounding success. As previously reported, the group (participants listed in the early blog entry [here](http://mith.umd.edu/mith-barn-raising-continues/)) split into two teams: one working to extend the tei-ann plugin for CKEditor (http://sourceforge.net/projects/teiann/) to allow for TEI-lite annotations, and one building an XML source editor with color coding and code suggestion. The first team produced a preliminary stakeholders document which is currently being used by the designers of the original plugin to create a roadmap for future development. The second team has produced a working prototype of their source editor, _Angles_, which can be tested [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20111121222306/http://mith.umd.edu/staff/dreside/RaiseXML/) and downloaded from [here](https://github.com/dougreside/RaiseXML). At present none of the menu options (file, edit, help) on _Angles_ have been activated, but typing an angle bracket (&lt;) in the text area will activate the autocomplete feature to suggest possible tags for that location. If you're interested in joining either effort, email us at mith (
