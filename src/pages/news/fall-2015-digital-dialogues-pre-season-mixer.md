---

Good news! So many of you expressed interest in having a Fall 2015 Digital Dialogues Pre-Season Mixer, that we will definitely be holding the event here at MITH on [**Tuesday, September 27, 2015 at 12:30pm**](https://www.facebook.com/events/926409637429092/). Although we asked all of you to express initial interest by this past Tuesday the 14th through the online survey, you can still RSVP up until the day before the event.

For those of you who didn’t see the [original announcement](http://us5.campaign-archive2.com/?u=a8d75192a2b95e6989ddab385&id=5b9798d202), the mixer is a chance for you to come see our our offices, meet MITH staff members, and engage with other faculty and staff members on campus who are interested in digital scholarly work in the humanities. There will be refreshments served, as well as a few brief lightning talks with graduate students discussing their research and projects.
