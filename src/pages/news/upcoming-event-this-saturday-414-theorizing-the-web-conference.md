**THEORIZING THE WEB CONFERENCE** **APRIL 14, 2012** **UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND** [cyborgology.org/theorizingtheweb](http://web.archive.org/web/20140705121326/http://www.cyborgology.org:80/theorizingtheweb/2012/) #TtW12

On Saturday April 14, the University will host the second annual Theorizing the Web conference in the Art-Sociology building, where emerging and established researchers, activists, educators and artists from around the world will meet to explore the social implications of the Internet. Last year's event drew over 250 people and included 14 panels, two workshops, two symposia, two plenaries by Saskia Sassen and George Ritzer, and a keynote by danah boyd of Microsoft Research. This year we're focused on bringing in perspectives not usually heard in technology circles and on the ways the Internet refigures political processes. The pay-what-you-want-to-register 2012 edition of Theorizing the Web will feature 10 panels, artistic installations, a film screening, a film and Twitter (#ttw12) conversation beyond the conference's walls, and a keynote conversation between Zeynep Tufekci of UNC and Andy Carvin of NPR News on the shifting practices and institutions of news media.
