MITH is pleased to announce that Google has selected us as one of a hundred seventy seven mentoring organizations to participate in the [2013 Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013). Google is offering students a stipend to work with MITH and other organizations on open source projects, giving students an opportunity to see software development and open source culture outside the classroom.

If you are a student interested in programming and literature, music, or some other aspect of the humanities and libraries, check out [our page of ideas](http://mith.umd.edu/gsoc2013/) and [our GSoC homepage](http://web.archive.org/web/20130414060905/http://www.google-melange.com:80/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/umd_mith). Feel free to [drop us an email](mailto:jimsmith@umd.edu) or [join us on IRC](irc://irc.freenode.net/%23mith) to discuss potential projects.

**About Google Summer of Code**

Google Summer of Code is a global program that offers student developers stipends to write code for various open source software projects. Google works with many open source, free software, and technology-related groups to identify and fund projects over a three month period. Since its inception in 2005, the program has brought together nearly six thousand successful student participants and over three thousand mentors from over a hundred countries worldwide, all for the love of code.

Through Google Summer of Code, accepted student applicants are paired with a mentor or mentors from the participating projects, thus gaining exposure to real-world software development scenarios and the opportunity for employment in areas related to their academic pursuits. In turn, the participating projects are able to more easily identify and bring in new developers. Best of all, more source code is created and released for the use and benefit of all.
