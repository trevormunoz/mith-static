I had been holding out for my next post for a new Digital Mishnah website, courtesy of MITH, and a new collation demo hosted on it, but, that will be for my next post, _deo volente_.

Since my last confession, I have:

- Submitted a paper that details methods and progress to date. It’s for a Festschrift, and I’ve been asked not to state the venue openly, but can share a draft.
- Thought a lot about (and only partly understand) multivariate statistics.
- Completed the first round of markup for all the Genizah fragments for my sample chapter. A second round of markup linking the fragments to the reference text needs to be done (next bullet). Formatted versions of these texts will be viewable
- Started rethinking how to handle the encoding of highly fragmentary texts. In particular, I’ve found four pieces of a single sheet of text in two different locations in the Taylor-Schechter collection (TS AS 78.69 + TS AS 78.162 + TS AS 78.235 + TS NS 329.286; the sheet adjoins another single sheet from a third box, TS E2.71). For the present, we are encoding each fragment as a document, and recording the extent of the lacunae at the edges of the fragment as fitting within the smallest properly oriented rectangle that encloses the fragment. What needs doing is a pointing scheme that will point into the reference text.
- Identified the next fragments to work on to expand the work to Tractate _Neziqin_ (aka the _Bavot_), and started to recruit people to work on it.

Next up, completing fragmentary texts; encoding the remaining Mishnah texts in the Babylonian Talmud mss., and learning some Java.
