A MITH Digital Dialogue

Tuesday, April 1, 12:30-1:45

MITH Conference Room, McKeldin Library B0135

"To Read or Not to Read: A Discussion of the NEA's Latest Report about Reading"

by SUNIL IYENGAR

To Read or Not To Read: A Question of National Consequence &lt;<http://www.nea.gov/news/news07/TRNR.html>> gathers statistics from more than 40 studies on the reading habits and skills of children, teenagers, and adults. The compendium reveals recent declines in voluntary reading and test scores alike, exposing trends that have severe consequences for American society. Like its controversial predecessor, Reading at Risk (2004), the new report has provoked a widespread debate with recent coverage in such outlets at the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the Guardian. SUNIL IYENGAR, one of the primary architects of the report, will present an overview of its findings and take questions about its methodology and conclusions.

SUNIL IYENGAR directs the Office of Research and Analysis at the National Endowment for the Arts. In November 2007, Mr. Iyengar's office released To Read or Not To Read: A Question of National Consequence, a new and comprehensive analysis of reading patterns in the United States. He also manages a national evaluation project for the Big Read. The Office of Research and Analysis is responsible for the U.S. Survey of Public Participation in the Arts and for routine dissemination of research notes on various arts topics ranging from performing artist income trends to classical music radio program access.

His book reviews have appeared in publications such as The Washington Post, New York Times, San Francisco Chronicle, The American Scholar, The New Criterion, and Contemporary Poetry Review. He was a board member of the American Poetry & Literacy Project, co-founded by Andrew Carroll and the late Joseph Brodsky. Mr. Iyengar earned his B.A. in English from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
