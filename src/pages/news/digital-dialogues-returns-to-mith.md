Beginning February 15th, _Digital Dialogues_ returns to MITH on Tuesday afternoons from 12:30-1:45PM during the academic semester. Digital Dialogues are an occasion for discussion, presentation, and intellectual exchange. Guests are welcome to bring their lunches and all talks are open to the public.

At this time we'd like to announce our slate of February presenters. [Trevor Owens](http://www.trevorowens.org/), digital archivist at the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIIPP) in the Office of Strategic Initiatives at the Library of Congress and a doctoral student in the Graduate School of Education at George Mason University will kick off our spring schedule on February 15th. The following Tuesday (February 22nd), we welcome [Julie Meloni](http://www.academicsandbox.com/), Chief Architect, Online Library Environment, University of Virginia.

Later in the semester, we look forward to presentations by [Tim Carmody](http://snarkmarket.com/author/tim), [Mary Flanagan](http://www.maryflanagan.com/), [Travis Brown](http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/travis-brown/), [Jim Smith](http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/james-smith), [Richard Grusin](http://www4.uwm.edu/c21/pages/about/staff/richard.html), Maria Velazquez, [Seth Denbo](http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/seth-denbo), [Neil Fraistat](http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/neil-fraistat), [Siva Vaidhyanathan](http://www.googlizationofeverything.com/), and perhaps a few more.
