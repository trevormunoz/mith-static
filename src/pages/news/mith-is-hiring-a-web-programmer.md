Faculty Research Assistant (Web Programmer)

The Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) at the University of Maryland in College Park seeks a web programmer to work on two grant funded projects. The first involves the creation of a collaboratively-edited database of 3-dimensional models of historical theater buildings. The second will integrate MITH's web-based multimedia annotation tool (AXE) into the Center for History and New Media's world-renowned citation management system, Zotero. Both are potentially very high profile projects in the digital humanities and it is likely this one year appointment will lead to other exciting opportunities in the digital humanities.

The successful candidate will at the minimum have a bachelor's degree and will be proficient in PHP, XML, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. Familiarity with cross browser compatibility issues and the ability to work well individually and in a team environment and to produce high-quality work under tightly defined deadlines is also essential. The ideal candidate will also have thorough knowledge of SVG (scalar vector graphics), ActionScript 3.0, and the Yahoo User Interface (YUI).

Located in McKeldin Library at the heart of the campus, MITH is the University of Maryland's primary intellectual hub for scholars and practitioners of digital humanities, new media, and cyberculture. MITH's house research includes projects in text mining, tool building, visualization, digital libraries, electronic publishing, and digital preservation. We collaborate actively with allied campus units, including the University Libraries, the College of Information Science, and the Human Computer Interaction Lab. Situated in a suburb of Washington DC, MITH also offers all of the opportunities that come from the libraries, museums, and cultural institutions of the area.

Salary range: $45,000 - $55,000, commensurate with experience. The University also offers a comprehensive benefits package, including 22 Days Annual Leave; 15 Days Sick Leave; 3 Days Personal Leave; 15 Paid Holidays; Tuition Remission; Health, Dental, Vision and Prescription coverage.
