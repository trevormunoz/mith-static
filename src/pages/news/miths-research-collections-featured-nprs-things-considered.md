title: MITH's Research & Collections featured on NPR's All Things Considered
---

When National Public Radio's daily news show [All Things Considered](http://www.npr.org/programs/all-things-considered/) wanted to do a piece on the challenges of digital archives and preservation, they contacted MITH about coming to our offices for an interview. Last week, Audie Cornish came to MITH and interviewed several of our research staff including Executive Director [Neil Fraistat](http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/neil-fraistat/), Associate Director [Trevor Muñoz](http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/trevor-munoz/), and BitCurator Community Lead [Porter Olsen](http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/porter-olsen/), regarding MITH's various projects related to digital archives and digital forensics, including the [Deena Larsen Collection](http://mith.umd.edu/research/deena-larsen-collection/), the [Bill Bly Collection of Electronic Literature](http://mith.umd.edu/research/bill-bly-collection/), and the [BitCurator Project](http://mith.umd.edu/research/bitcurator/).

The resulting piece will air TODAY, April 9th, on [All Things Considered](http://www.npr.org/programs/all-things-considered/). Check the NPR site to discover your local air time(s). If you missed the show, it will be available soon on both the MITH site as well as on NPR.
