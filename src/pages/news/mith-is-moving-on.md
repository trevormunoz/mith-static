Yesterday we trekked over to [Hornbake Library](http://www.lib.umd.edu/HBK/) to check out MITH's future location. After 12 years in McKeldin Library, additional staff and research expansion warrant a more robust space, and we're excited. Amid the current occupant large book collection and VHS film archive, Director Neil Fraistat helped us envision an open-floor layout twice the size of our McKeldin office, and filled with light from floor-to-ceiling windows. Two glass walls frame a courtyard of green (do I hear Zen garden?), and we've already elected Grant Dickie as MITH Gardener. With [Digital Collections](http://digital.lib.umd.edu/), [Nonprint Media Services](http://www.lib.umd.edu/nonprint) and the [iSchool](http://ischool.umd.edu/) as our neighbors, we hope to convert our new space in Hornbake into a digital hub of the humanities. Please return to our blog, and follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/UMD_MITH) under hashtag [#mithmove](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23mithmove) for updates regarding the move.
