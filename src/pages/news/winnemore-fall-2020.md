_The 2020 Winnemore Fellowship will now be awarded for the Fall semester. The application deadline has been changed to **November 5, 2019.**_

MITH is pleased to announce that we are accepting applications for the Fall 2020 Winnemore Digital Humanities Dissertation Fellowship. The Winnemore Fellowship provides support to a University of Maryland graduate student whose dissertation engages with digital humanities or new media and the arts and humanities.

Eligible graduate students must be enrolled in an appropriate terminal degree program (Ph.D. or M.F.A) at the University of Maryland and must agree not to accept any other form of financial support from the University or other fellowships of $2,000 or more during the term for which this fellowship is awarded. Winnemore Fellows are provided a stipend of $9,929 and a \$1,509 contribution toward health insurance fees. Fellows are also provided with work space at MITH, consultation with MITH staff about their project, and technical support (including server space) where applicable.

Fellows are expected to be in-residence throughout the duration of their fellowship. They are encouraged to attend MITH events such as Digital Dialogues, contribute to the intellectual community of MITH, share their work on the MITH blog, participate in professional development opportunities, and be engaged with the digital humanities more broadly.

Interested applicants should submit:

- a cover letter that includes your name, program/department, college, email, phone, title of dissertation, and advisor’s name, phone, and email. The cover letter should also include the date that you completed coursework and any other degree requirements, the date that you passed your prospectus/proposal examination, the date you advanced to candidacy, and the proposed date for your dissertation defense. All dates should include month and year;

- a current short CV;

- a 250-word abstract written for a general audience including your name and the title of your dissertation or project.

- the proposal itself, which should be no longer than three pages and which should specifically address the following points:

  - the project that you will work on if awarded the fellowship;
  - how the use of advanced technology would help achieve your research goals and contribute to the intellectual outcome
  - a statement of work completed to date;
  - a detailed timetable or work plan for duration of the fellowship including the projected date of completion.

- two confidential letters of recommendation, including one from your dissertation director that outlines how the applicant’s advisor will support the student’s effort for the duration of the fellowship in addition to the merit of the applicant.

A committee composed of digital humanities faculty and staff will review applications. Proposals should specify how a Winnemore Fellowship would be crucial to the dissertation or equivalent project’s development. The committee will place emphasis on projects that center the perspectives of underrepresented or oppressed groups and such proposals are highly encouraged. Also encouraged are projects addressing complex ethical issues inherent to engagement with new media, cultural heritage data, and the digital humanities.

We encourage applicants to consult with MITH regarding their applications. All application materials should be sent in PDF format to [Purdom Lindblad](mailto:purdom@umd.edu), by 11:59 PM **Tuesday, November 5, 2019.** Announcement of the Winnemore Fellow will be made by Friday, December 13, 2019.
