---

The [Editing Modernism in Canada](http://editingmodernism.ca/) (EMiC) Project and the Digital Humanities Winter Institute are delighted to announce the 8th course for the upcoming 2013 institute. Digital Editions, led by EMiC director [Dean Irvine](http://editingmodernism.ca/about-us/director/), is designed for individuals and groups who are interested in creating scholarly digital editions. Topics covered will include an overview of planning and project management, workflow and labour issues, and tools available for edition production. Participants will be working with the [Modernist Commons](http://modernistcommons.ca/), a collaborative digital editing environment and repository designed by EMiC in collaboration with Islandora and its software-services company DiscoveryGarden.

This course was made possible through the generous sponsorship of EMiC. We invite you to visit [DHWI](http://mith.umd.edu/research/dhwi-2013/ "DHWI 2013") and [EMiC](http://editingmodernism.ca/) to learn more about this training opportunity and this exciting international project.
