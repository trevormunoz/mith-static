## Monitoring Climate Data on the Web

Ray Cha _Software Project Manager_ Environmental Data and Governance Initiative

MITH Conference Room 11:00 am – 12:00 pm, 2:00 – 3:00 pm

Please join us on May 10 from 11:00 am – 12:00 pm in MITH for a presentation by Ray Cha, who is helping direct the efforts of the [Environmental Data and Governance Initiative](https://envirodatagov.org/) (EDGI) to monitor federal websites that provide access to information about climate change, the environment, and energy. The presentation and discussion will be followed in the afternoon (2 – 3 pm) with an informal demonstration to get a more hands on understanding of how EDGI’s volunteers work. Participants are welcome to attend either (or both) sessions.

EDGI is an international network of academics and non-profits addressing potential threats to federal environmental and energy policy, and to the scientific research infrastructure built to investigate, inform, and enforce them. Dismantling this infrastructure—which ranges from databases to satellites to models for climate, air, and water—could imperil the public's right to know, the United States' standing as a scientific leader, corporate accountability, and environmental protection.

EDGI is monitoring changes to thousands of federal environmental agency webpages to document and analyze the way environmental data either disappears or otherwise changes, sometimes in subtle but significant ways.

More about EDGI’s work monitoring federal government websites can be found in their recent [Changing the Digital Climate: How Climate Change Web Content is Being Censored Under the Trump Administration](http://100days.envirodatagov.org/changing-digital-climate/).
