MITH is pleased to announce we have accepted an invitation to join Georgetown and George Mason as third regional host of the Washington DC Area Technology and Humanities Forum. Co-sponsored by the [Center for History & New Media (CHNM)](http://chnm.gmu.edu/) at GMU and the [Center for New Designs in Learning & Scholarship (CNDLS)](http://cndls.georgetown.edu/) at Georgetown---and now MITH at Maryland---the DC Area Technology and Humanities Forum explores important issues in humanities computing and provides an opportunity for DC area scholars interested the uses of new technology in the humanities to meet and get acquainted.

Look for a program at Georgetown this spring, followed by MITH hosting its first event next fall.
