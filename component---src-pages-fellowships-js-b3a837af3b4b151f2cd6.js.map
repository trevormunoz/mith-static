Fellows are also provided with work space at MITH, consultation with MITH staff about their project, and technical support (including server space) where applicable.</p>\n        <p>Fellows are expected to be in-residence throughout the duration of their fellowship.  They are encouraged to attend MITH events such as Digital Dialogues, contribute to the intellectual community of MITH, share their work on the MITH blog, participate in professional development opportunities, and be engaged with the digital humanities more broadly.</p>\n        <p>Interested applicants should submit:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>a cover letter that includes your name, program/department, college, email, phone, title of dissertation, and advisor’s name, phone, and email.

Proposals should specify how a Winnemore Fellowship would be crucial to the dissertation or equivalent project’s development. The committee will place emphasis on projects that center the perspectives of underrepresented or oppressed groups and such proposals are highly encouraged. Also encouraged are projects addressing complex ethical issues inherent to engagement with new media, cultural heritage data, and the digital humanities.</p>\n        <p>We will begin accepting applications in Spring 2021 for Spring 2022 fellowships.</p>\n      </section>\n      <section className=\"col-6\">\n        <h2>Clara and Robert Vambery Distinguished Professor of Comparative Studies</h2>\n        <p>In December 1996 the Clara and Robert Vambery Fund was established to honor the memory of Clara Vambery and the significant achievements of Robert Vambery, the dramaturge for the original production of Bertoldt Brecht’s <em>Three Penny Opera</em>, who made substantial contributions to the history of German drama and had an abiding interest in the use of music in the theater. The Clara and Robert Vambery Fund provides for appointment of a Clara and Robert Vambery Distinguished Professor of Comparative Studies.</p>\n        <p>Faculty recipients of the Clara and Robert Vambery Distinguished Professor of Comparative Studies are selected on the basis of demonstrated work in European and American comparative literary studies in print, in film, or in other newly discovered technological forms.
